Driven by analogies between the hierarchical structures of proteins and many forms of music, multiple attempts of mapping proteins to music have been made. Previous works have either worked at a low level, mapping amino acid to notes, or at a higher level, using the overall structure as a basis for composition.Areas covered: We report a comprehensive mapping strategy that encompasses the encoding of the geometry of proteins, in addition to the amino acid sequence and secondary structure information. This leads to a piece of music that is both more complete and closely linked to the original protein. By using this mapping, we can invert the process and map music to proteins, retrieving not only the amino acid sequence but also the secondary structure and folding from musical data.Expert opinion: We can train a machine learning model on ‘protein music’ to generate new music that can be translated to new proteins. By selecting proper datasets and conditioning parameters on the generative model, we could tune de novo proteins with high level parameters to achieve certain protein design features.","2019-12-02","2023-07-12 05:12:28","2023-07-12 05:12:28","2023-07-12 05:12:09","875-879","","11-12","16","","","Sounds interesting","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/14789450.2019.1697236 PMID: 31756126","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/AMLQMSDV/Franjou et al. - 2019 - Sounds interesting can sonification help us desig.pdf","","","sonification; music; sound; design; amino acids; Biomateriomics; materiomusic; proteins","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fact that a machine can process image and sound in parallel, and by the same algorithm, does not establish that the human brain can. The transparency of an algorithmic process to a listener-viewer-screener is a core issue in auditory display (or ‘sonification’).

Overcoming these challenges might be simplified by adding sound to the representation. This is called sonification. As sonification provides additional information to the visual information, sonification could be useful in supporting the visual perception. In the present study, usefulness (in terms of accuracy and response time) of sonification was investigated with an interactive sonification test. In the test, participants were asked to identify the highest brightness level in a monochrome visual representation. The task was performed in four conditions, one with no sonification and three with different sonification settings. The results show that sonification is useful, as measured by higher task accuracy, and that the participant's musicality facilitates the use of sonification with better performance when sonification was used. The results were also supported by subjective measurements, where participants reported an experienced benefit of sonification.","2019-10-03","2023-07-12 05:12:28","2023-07-12 05:12:28","2023-07-12 05:12:12","1028-1037","","10","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2019.1657952","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/T63FKW9Y/Rönnberg - 2019 - Musical sonification supports visual discriminatio.pdf","","","Interactive sonification; visualisation; multimodality; musical elements; visual perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They play a central role in everyday life, scientific research, and also fine arts. Especially in the visual arts, linking the auditory and the visual realms is not uncommon. However, when it comes to linking the visual domain with the audio domain, the possibilities there are less addressed. Therefore, in this paper, we conceptualize the so-called cruxes for sonification of the visual domain. These are hierarchically structured transformations of the main elements in both domains, starting at the physics level, then extending to the physiological level, and finally to the artistic level. They offer a strong basis for creative sonification efforts and are intended for computer-based (generative) art production. In brief, this paper shows that sonification has a strong potential for artistic sonic creations, where scientific basis can play an important role, when linking the visual, acoustic, and physiological domains.","2021-10-02","2023-07-12 05:12:28","2023-07-12 05:12:28","2023-07-12 05:12:13","293-306","","4","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/14626268.2021.2002913","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/XHCL2VGE/Trček - 2021 - Cruxes for visual domain sonification in digital a.pdf","","","sonification; generative arts; sound realm; visual realm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through conducting expert interviews (N = 11), we created an initial sonification algorithm that accounts for art style, lightness, and color diversity to modulate the sonified output in terms of tempo and pitch. This algorithm was evaluated through user evaluations (N = 22).

I argue that this delicate balancing act can be regarded as an expression of what historian of science Thomas Kuhn has referred to as the “essential tension” of science between convention and iconoclasm; here: between questioning a scientific status quo (equated with a “visual bias”) and conforming to it.

The core instrument modules will be launched in 2019 for the 400th anniversary of Johannes Kepler's Harmonies of the World, in which he laid out a framework for the harmony of geometric form as well as the three laws of planetary motion. Kepler's own experimental process can be understood as audio-first because he employed his understanding of Western Classical music theory to investigate and discover the heliocentric, elliptical behaviour of planetary orbits. Indeed, principles of harmonic motion govern much of our physical world and show up at all scales in mathematics and physics. Few physical systems, however, offer such rich harmonic complexity and beauty as our own solar system. Concordia is a musical instrument that is modular, extensible and designed to allow players to generate and explore transparent sonifications of planetary movements rooted in the musical and mathematical concepts of Johannes Kepler as well as researchers who have extended Kepler's work, such as Hartmut Warm. Its primary function is to emphasise the auditory experience by encouraging musical explorations using sonification of geometric and relational information of scientifically accurate planetary ephemeris and astrodynamics. Concordia highlights harmonic relationships of the solar system through interactive sonic immersion. This article explains how we prioritise data sonification and then add visualisations and gamification to create a new type of experience and creative distributed-ledger powered ecosystem. Kepler Concordia facilitates the perception of music while presenting the celestial harmonies through multiple senses, with an emphasis on hearing, so that, as Kepler wrote, ‘the mind can seize upon the patterns’.","2020-01-01","2023-07-12 05:12:28","2023-07-12 05:12:28","2023-07-12 05:12:20","88-103","","1","49","","","Concordia","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/09298215.2020.1714666","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/IR8DLP2X/Snook et al. - 2020 - Concordia A musical XR instrument for playing the.pdf","","","Sonification; astronomy; mathematics; ephemeris; immersive media; musical instruments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contrasting prior sonification research, this study’s unique empirical evidence suggests that participants can indeed successfully interpret sonified displays containing continuous spatial data. Specifically, the auditory variable pitch leads to significantly better response accuracy, compared to the sound variable duration. Background and training has a weak effect on data interpretation performance with the auditory display. The more immersive the experienced soundscape, the better participants can interpret the sonified terrain.

We found that even though sonifications were new to them, participants were able to use them to gain impressions of the corresponding plots. The second phase deployed sonifications to all students on an Open University (OU) module. Although many of the students who chose to respond did so negatively, some found the sonifications an interesting augmentation of the plot. Overall, we demonstrate that for a subset of students, information in a plot can be communicated using sonifications.","2019-01-02","2023-07-12 05:12:28","2023-07-12 05:12:28","2023-07-12 05:12:23","19-39","","1","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/02680513.2018.1553707","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/M99IWU7Y/Vines et al. - 2019 - Sonification of numerical data for education.pdf","","","Accessibility; mathematics; audio graphs; sonifications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sonification can be defined as the use of sound to display data of scientific interest in order to investigate structures, trends or patterns in the data. Background is provided from several perspectives: the use of the senses in the history of science, the strengths of human hearing, the recent technological availability of auditory interfaces, the development of sonification itself, and differentiation of sonification from musical practices. In Western science, as in Western culture, the eye has become the predominant organ of sense; using the ear consciously in research thus implicitly questions the implications of the eye's predominance. As practical examples, two applications of sonification to data-sets from the social sciences are discussed in detail. We argue that the most promising areas of application of sonification within the social sciences are in the exploration of sequential data. Our two examples both concern sets of sequential data, one temporal, the other spatial (geographical). Discussion of these examples is followed by consideration of the practical and cultural implications of working with sonification. We thus hope to further the use of sonification in the social sciences, not as an alternative to visualisation or statistical approaches, but as a complementary tool of data analysis and exploration.","2006-12-01","2023-07-12 05:12:28","2023-07-12 05:12:28","2023-07-12 05:12:25","349-364","","4","31","","","Sounds sequential","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1179/030801806X143286","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/E346HZFF/Dayé and de Campo - 2006 - Sounds sequential sonification in the social scie.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further exploration, tracing the millennia of primitive sound-processing strategies as well as the many contexts which involve body movements and rhythms, leads to the realization that a composer who ventures outside traditional stylistic conventions of music-making will benefit from attention to these factors.

In this paper, we survey some basic theories of sound-motion similarity in music, and in particular the motor theory perspective.

By drawing on Bruno Latour’s discussion on hybrids (1993) as well as with reference to examples of the use of sonification in gallery spaces, the article argues that rather than assuming the artwork to be a finished and stable object, movement sonification approaches the artwork as a blueprint of proximal, conceptual and material relationships which are animated by a moving-listening subject.

Most of the use cases we generated were then tested, apart from meditation, and user opinions were collected in a driving simulator study (N = 20). Results indicated participants were interested in functions that support their experience with both driving and non-driving related interactions in highly automated vehicles. Three categories of use cases for level 4 automated vehicles were developed: driving automation use cases, immersion use cases, and in-vehicle notification use cases. For the driving simulator study, we tested three display modalities for interaction with drivers: visual alert only, non-speech with visual, and speech with visual.

In this paper, we propose the use of several time-varying information measures, computed in the context of a probabilistic model that evolves as a sample of the process unfolds, as a way to characterise temporal structure in music. One such measure is a novel predictive information rate which we conjecture may provide a conceptually simple explanation for the ‘inverted-U’ relationship often found between simple measures of randomness (e.g. entropy rate) and judgements of aesthetic value [Berlyne, D.E. (1971), Aesthetics and Psychobiology, New York: Appleton Century Crofts.]. We explore these ideas in the context of Markov chains using both artificially generated sequences and two pieces of minimalist music by Philip Glass, showing that even such a manifestly simplistic model (the Markov chain), when interpreted according to information dynamic principles, produces a structural analysis which largely agrees with that of an expert human listener. Thus, we propose that our approach could form the basis of a theoretically coherent yet computationally plausible model of human perception of formal structure, potentially including seemingly abstract qualities like interestingness and aesthetic goodness.","2009-09-01","2023-07-12 05:14:00","2023-07-12 05:14:00","2023-07-12 05:13:40","89-117","","2-3","21","","","Information dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/09540090902733756","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/EE8KX3BK/Abdallah and Plumbley - 2009 - Information dynamics patterns of expectation and .pdf","","","music; information theory; Bayesian inference; expectation; Markov chain; subjective probability; surprise","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to the position, the system renders curve properties such as curve shape, inflexion points and curvature through sound metaphors. The goal of this sonification approach is to strengthen the user's understanding of the shape of a virtual prototype, and to inform the user about geometrical attributes that could otherwise remain unseen.

The framework proposes articulation of user-defined sonified exercise spaces (SESs) tailored to psychological needs and physical capabilities that enhance body and movement awareness to rebuild confidence in physical activity. A smartphone-based wearable device and a Kinect-based device were designed based on the framework to track movement and breathing and sonify them during physical activity. In control studies conducted to evaluate the sonification strategies, people with CP reported increased performance, motivation, awareness of movement, and relaxation with sound feedback. Home studies, a focus group, and a survey of CP patients conducted at the end of a hospital pain management session provided an in-depth understanding of how different aspects of the SESs and their calibration can facilitate self-directed rehabilitation and how the wearable version of the device can facilitate transfer of gains from exercise to feared or demanding activities in real life.

In the larger context of electroacoustic music, and more specifically in acousmatic music where causal visual information is removed, it is interesting to investigate how a sense of human agency may be evoked by sound alone. An intuitive starting point would be to assume that the listener identifies source and cause through a sound’s close proximity to a known archetype, yet composers often work with materials offering less obvious source clues, while expanding the spatial image over many loudspeakers. New technologies allow us to accurately control the movement of sound in space, and because we understand our own bodies in spatial terms, it is natural to ask how a sound’s spatial behaviour influences our listening understanding. This paper investigates two research questions: can listeners identify human agency in 3-D sound, and if so, what are the most salient features involved in this process? Besides being of interest to electroacoustic composers, the topic is also relevant to the audio industry utilising high density loudspeaker arrays in cinema and other spaces where the projection of high resolution spatial imagery is possible.","2018-10-20","2023-07-12 05:14:00","2023-07-12 05:14:00","2023-07-12 05:13:47","399-415","","5","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/09298215.2018.1437187","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/DBDJUHTM/Barrett and Crispino - 2018 - The impact of 3-D sound spatialisation on listener.pdf","","","acousmatic music; human agency; Sound spatialisation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

UnWind incorporates the benefits of biofeedback and sedative music to facilitate deep breathing, moderate arousal, and promote mental relaxation. We evaluated Unwind in a 2 × 2 factorial experiment with music and biofeedback as independent factors. Forty young adults performed the relaxation exercise under one of the following conditions after experiencing a stressful task: Nature sounds only (NS), Nature sounds with music (NM), and Auditory biofeedback with nature sounds (NSBFB), and UnWind musical biofeedback (NMBFB). The results revealed a significant interaction effect between music and biofeedback on the improvement of heart rate variability.

Moreover, the precise concept of gesture has a decisive role in understanding musical performance. In this article, we apply some concepts of category theory to compare gestures of orchestral musicians, and to investigate the relationship between orchestra and conductor, as well as between listeners and conductor/orchestra. To this aim, we will introduce the concept of gestural similarity.

To answer the research question How intuitive are sound dimensions to communicate uncertainty? we carry out a cognitive experiment, where participants were asked to interpret the certainty/uncertainty level in two sounds A and B (N = 33). We produce sound stimuli by varying sound dimensions, including loudness, duration, location, pitch, register, attack, decay, rate of change, noise, timbre, clarity, order, and harmony. In the stimuli, both synthetic and natural sounds are used to allow comparison.

In many established disciplines, the conventions that guide the use of these skills and representations are taken for granted; but within ICAD, they are often explicitly negotiated. The practice of ‘data karaoke', in which researchers mimic the sound of a sonification with their own voice, is particularly instructive for understanding these negotiations, and the ICAD community more generally. Data karaoke fulfils five functions: embodiment, highlighting, illustration, authorisation and integration. To make sense of data karaoke, we have to understand the institutional and intellectual environment in which this peculiar practice has emerged; but conversely, an understanding of data karaoke can help us throw new light on epistemological debates about the hierarchy of the senses: data karaoke is a multisensory skill engaging the whole body of the sonification researcher, and thus calls into question the dominant epistemological discourse within the ICAD community, in which the different sensory modalities are framed as competitors. The ICAD case shows that studying conferences as sites where bodies interact, and presentations as performances involving the bodies and senses of scientists, helps us to understand not only the conference cultures, but also the ideals about scientific scholarship and academic authority held by scientific communities.","2015-10-02","2023-07-12 05:15:44","2023-07-12 05:15:44","2023-07-12 05:15:23","436-457","","4","24","","","Data Karaoke","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/09505431.2015.1052390","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/2XPN4P5H/Supper - 2015 - Data Karaoke Sensory and Bodily Skills in Confere.pdf","","","sonification; sound; academic conferences; bodily practices; hierarchy of the senses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The technology for embodied interaction involves microchip “enhancement” of the human body, enabling the body as the music controller or musical actuator and connecting the performer with a networked (wireless) sonic performance environment. To examine the ways that the audience and performer respond to this new performance paradigm, this article first looks at some interpretations and understandings of posthumanisim and cyborgism and its effects for the music performer and audience. The influential body modifying and skin boundary cultures that colour audience perception and motivate cyborg processes, the body as expressive canvas and politicising cyborgism are considered in relation to alterity, community, marking and anthropology. The further social implications of radiofrequency identification tag technology and computing technologies that transfigure our body-limits and sense of self, privacy and human–machine integration are considered, particularly as contemporary posthuman tele-tactile technologies challenge conventional notions of touch and control. The Virtual Gamelan performance environment is presented as a test-bed for precision gestural interaction with sound, and to gauge audience feedback about these contentious contemporary issues that bleed into other pervasive technologies of the imminent future. This research was developed from the perspective of the music composer/performer and the motivation to explore posthuman cyborg notions through the embodiment of sensors in the disciplines of music, human–computer interaction, and design in a technological cyborg discussion that positions it differently to “mythological” cyborg discourse. The embodiment and permeation of the body are integral to the research goal of altering music performance paradigms. While utilising gesture, proprioception and spatial interaction, the embodiment of part of the system differentiates this approach from the Theremin or virtual interfaces with a physical controller (such as Guitar Hero or six-degrees-of-freedom devices with buttons and touch as well as motion, e.g. a Nintendo Wii controller) or the Xbox 360 Kinect, which uses low-latency life-like motion control of the on-screen avatar remote from the body of the performer.","2011-09-01","2023-07-12 05:15:44","2023-07-12 05:15:44","2023-07-12 05:15:25","547-568","","4","21","","","Tele-touch embodied controllers","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10350330.2011.591997","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/Q4Z4LXG5/Beilharz - 2011 - Tele-touch embodied controllers posthuman gestura.pdf","","","proprioception; cyborg music performance; gestural sound control; networked music performance; posthumanism; radiofrequency identification tags; sensor interaction; tele-tactile music","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among them, Hèctor Parra (b. 1976) has been particularly impressed by recent developments in gravitational physics and astrophysics, namely the part of astronomy dealing with gravity rather than light. Black holes, gravitational waves, cosmology, or quantum gravity models belong to such fields of intensive research, bringing surprising new concepts such as the coarse-graining of space–time, the multiverse or the holographic principle. In this framework, we have collaborated on the conception of a large piece for ensemble, orchestra and live electronics, which tries to transpose gravitational phenomena into a new form of contemporary music.","2019-03-04","2023-07-12 05:15:44","2023-07-12 05:15:44","2023-07-12 05:15:27","193-205","","1-2","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/07494467.2019.1578129","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/KI53YBWW/Luminet - 2019 - Gravitational Music.

By discussing Sonolope, a mobile phone application that enables the production of quadrophonic sound through the user’s movement in the space, this article aims to contribute to existing scholarship by examining the experience of sound and movement co-production in relation to the sensory modalities that underpin mobile phone use and through a set of philosophical accounts that focus on listening. It will be argued that Sonolope, as well as similar systems of movement sonification, can offer a third category of experience and analysis that transcends the existing binaries between external appearance and internal sensation, image and proprioception. It is thus intended to examine sound as an integral part of the user’s experience within movement sonification, and position such an experience in relation to somatic practice, mobile phone use and a wider philosophical project of developing a ‘sonorous subject’.","2017-01-02","2023-07-12 05:15:44","2023-07-12 05:15:44","2023-07-12 05:15:33","39-54","","1","13","","","Making the body all ears","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/14794713.2017.1300446","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/U4PZZLJ7/Kapsali - 2017 - Making the body all ears Sonolope and a somatic p.pdf","","","Movement sonification; mobile phones; movement improvisation; otocentric accounts; somatic practice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on the field of musicology, but also the scholarly turn to the senses as part of the broadening reach of cultural history, the article argues that Australia’s musical engagement with Antarctica constitutes a significant, though understudied, aspect of our aural heritage. Further, deeper and critical appreciation of this music as cultural and aural heritage enhances our ability to reflect on the full extent of Australia’s relationship with, and contribution to knowledge about, its ‘Great Frozen Neighbour’ and its identity as a ‘gateway’ to the Antarctic region.","2018-01-02","2023-07-12 05:15:44","2023-07-12 05:15:44","2023-07-12 05:15:34","63-82","","1","49","","","Composing Connections between Continents","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2017.1417456","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/5W5BC7CV/Philpott - 2018 - Composing Connections between Continents Tracing .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In fact, much audio software subtly encourages prefabricated aesthetic solutions via the user interface, resulting in a cookie-cutter approach to music creation. As a result, much of the electronic music we hear today rarely ventures into new territory by exploring new structures. One solution could be to employ a compositional tool that enables a composer to generate new and unusual structures derived from mathematical relationships such as the Fibonacci series, the Golden Ratio or other mathematical patterns found in nature. Luckily, such a tool exists and is part of a vast system of music composition created in the twentieth century by the visionary music theoretician and composer Joseph Schillinger. In this article the author explores a Schillinger technique called ‘composing with density groups’ which can be used to create unique musical structures on paper or in any digital audio workstation (DAW).","2011-04-01","2023-07-12 05:15:44","2023-07-12 05:15:44","2023-07-12 05:15:39","143-153","","2","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/07494467.2011.636201","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/HVG9XH2E/Cascone - 2011 - The Use of Density Groups in Electroacoustic Music.pdf","","","Compositional Structure; Density Groups; Interference; Resultants; Theory of Rhythm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Approaches of conveying versus communicating climate change in music are considered across a spectrum of musical forms, from contemporary and historical popular music to contemporary classical music and sound art. The article applies the framework of shifting baselines to music engaged with environmental change in order to formulate a closer relationship between objective and quantitative intergenerational biophysical change and subjective and qualitative socio-cultural change. To cease losing track of such inexorable degradation, the article speculates on future musical forms that may obviate such intergenerational myopia by conveying and/or communicating the unprecedented rapidity of biophysical change.","2018-01-02","2023-07-12 05:15:44","2023-07-12 05:15:44","2023-07-12 05:15:42","58-70","","1","12","","","Shifting Baselines","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/17524032.2017.1371051","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/8PSKZIRL/Wodak - 2018 - Shifting Baselines Conveying Climate Change in Po.pdf","","","climate change; environmental communication; environmental narratives; popular culture; Popular music; shifting baselines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we explore the extent to which music-oriented high school students achieve these two benefits when they participate in ‘Songwriting To Learn’, a possible variation on the Writing To Learn (WTL) model of instruction. We analysed 81 artist statements, collected over 12 years at an annual science fair, in which students described their music compositions and the compositions’ connections to science. Rather than simply reporting scientific facts in song lyrics, these students used an impressive variety of musical elements (Genre, Instruments, Lyrics, and Structure [i.e. chords, dynamics, melody, rhythm]) as metaphors or symbols for science-related elements (Scientific Topic, Conveying Information, Affect, Personal Story, Scientific Story). Many students demonstrated a sophisticated attention to musical details and nuances, consistent with their frequent self-identification as musicians and/or music fans. Moreover, in composing and performing songs, these students fulfilled some of the key criteria by which scientific identities are developed, including the forging of personal connections to science. By writing songs about science, students may use their practice-linked identities in the domain of music to express their growing understanding in the domain of science.","2018-10-02","2023-07-12 05:15:44","2023-07-12 05:15:44","2023-07-12 05:15:44","307-324","","4","8","","","Songwriting to learn","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/21548455.2018.1492758","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/3DUF7G87/Ward et al. - 2018 - Songwriting to learn how high school science fair.pdf","","","Arts integration; ArtSci; content-rich music; practice-linked identity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a platform for its development, they firstly observed and analysed video footage of conductors at the Royal Academy of Music, London using Elan software to create a gestural model. Subsequently, through gaining blind end-users’ feedback on the device, as well as an experiment to compare their timing using either (i) a two-dimension haptic signal or (ii) a metronomic pulsation, it is suggested that the development of technologies for this purpose should focus on the meaning the conductor intends to convey coupled with haptic signals blind end-users themselves deem suitable, rather than adopting a ‘sighted perspective’ in attempting faithful transference of two-dimensional captures of arm movements from one medium to another.

Some hints can be extended towards the visual arts. Mathematical approaches can also help formalize a “translation” from the visual domain to the auditory one and vice versa. Thus, a visual artwork can be mathematically investigated, then translated into music. The final, refined musical rendition can be compared to the initial visual idea. Can an artistic idea be preserved through these changes of media? Can a non-trivial pattern be envisaged in an artwork, and then still be identified after the change of medium? Here, we consider a contemporary installation and an ensemble musical piece derived from it. We first mathematically investigate the installation, finding its patterns and structure, and then we compare them with structure and patterns of the musical composition. In particular, we apply two concepts of mathematical music theory, the Quantum GestART and the gestural similarity conjecture, to the analysis of Qwalala, realized for the Venice Biennale by Pae White, comparing it to its musical rendition in the homonymous piece for harp and ensemble composed by Federico Favali.

Kinematics included boat acceleration and distance travelled, collected with Sofirow at two intensities of training. The boat acceleration-time traces were converted online into acoustic feedback and presented via speakers during rowing (sections with and without alternately). Repeated-measures within-participant factorial ANOVA showed greater boat speed with acoustic feedback than baseline (0.08 ± 0.01 m·s−1). The time structure of rowing cycles was improved (extended time of positive acceleration). Questioning of athletes showed acoustic feedback to be a supportive training aid as it provided important functional information about the boat motion independent of vision.

Despite several decades of research on brief auditory alerts for representing status and processes in user interfaces, there is no clear heuristic guidance for which type(s) of auditory alerts should be preferred for designing interfaces. We used evidence synthesis (systematic review and meta-analysis) to examine the effectiveness of different types of brief audio alerts. We identified articles comparing auditory icons (real-world sounds with an ecological relationship to their referent), earcons (abstract sounds with no ecological relationship to their referent), spearcons (accelerated/compressed speech), and speech alerts. We used meta-analysis to compare alerts across five different outcomes: accuracy, reaction time, subjective ratings, workload, and dual-task interference. For accuracy and reaction time, results indicated speech, spearcons, and other types of alerts (usually hybrid, e.g., spearcons plus speech) were superior to auditory icons, which in turn were superior to earcons. Earcons also were inferior to all other options with respect to subjective ratings. Analyses generally suggested parity among alert types for workload and dual-task interference. Based on currently available evidence, it appears that speech, spearcons, and hybrid (e.g., spearcons plus speech) auditory alerts result in better performance than auditory icons and especially earcons. Still, high heterogeneity in our analyses cannot rule out a wide range of possible effects, and our analyses could not directly address some of the concerns that have been raised regarding speech-based alerts. These findings can help to guide the selection of brief audio alerts in interface design.","2023-06-11","2023-07-12 05:17:34","2023-07-12 05:17:34","2023-07-12 05:17:25","1-30","","0","0","","","Auditory Icons, Earcons, Spearcons, and Speech","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/25742442.2023.2219201","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/8VI734J4/Nees and Liebman - 2023 - Auditory Icons, Earcons, Spearcons, and Speech A .pdf","","","sonification; Auditory displays; assistive technology; universal design; alarms; network meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I argue that claims to life in a sound also belie an anachronistic return to an early modern understanding of sound as particulate matter and suggest a technoscientific discourse in which sound and data are described in terms of one another. With a close engagement with microsounds – from Gilles Deleuze to computer music specialist Curtis Roads – this essay queries what sonic particulates are presumed to be when they are mapped onto Spinoza’s corpora simplicissima but processed through analogy synthesis or digital tools. In part, this essay tries to speak to a persistent separation of sonic materiality and auditory culture, in music and sound studies in which life in a sound cannot be thought apart from how life is subject to different kinds of extractions. With a return to Spinoza’s physics, this essay also retakes the often sloganized “no one knows what a body can do” to emphasize an ethical recomposition of the text in which to “know” must be as open-ended as “body” is typically emphasized to be.","2020-07-02","2023-07-12 05:17:34","2023-07-12 05:17:34","2023-07-12 05:17:27","465-488","","3","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/17496977.2020.1732707","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/J8YYI433/Cimini - 2020 - We don’t know that we don’t know what a body can d.pdf","","","aesthetic; modernism; Philosophy of music; sonic field","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This network can be viewed as a time series of a non-stationary signal, and as such, it can be partitioned for the automatic identification of tonal regions using time series analysis and change point detection without relying on comparisons with pre-determined reference sets or extensive corpora. I demonstrate that the essential features of tonal harmony, centricity, referentiality, directedness and hierarchy, emerge naturally from the network topology and its scale-free properties. Finally, solving for the minimal length path through a route optimization algorithm on these graphs provides an abstraction of harmonic sequences that can be generalized for the conception of generative models of tonal compositional design.","2023-05-04","2023-07-12 05:17:34","2023-07-12 05:17:34","2023-07-12 05:17:28","198-212","","2","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/17459737.2021.1969599","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/Y8649CUJ/Buongiorno Nardelli - 2023 - Tonal harmony and the topology of dynamical score .pdf","","","music information retrieval; composition; theory; music analysis; tonality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We consider the development of music with live electronics, with particular reference to the harp repertoire, and include interviews with six harpists that use technology in their professional performance practice. We then present HarpCI, a case study that explores how gestures can be used to control and transform sound and light projection in live performance with the electric harp. HarpCI draws on research from the areas Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Music Interaction Design (MiXD) to extend the creative possibilities available to the performer, and demonstrates our approach to bridging the gap between the performer/composer and the harp on one side, and the technology on the other. We discuss the use of guitar pedals with the electric harp, and the limitations they impose, and then introduce the MyoSpat system as a potential solution to this issue. MyoSpat aims to give musicians control over auditory and visual aspects of the performance through easy to learn, intuitive and natural hand gestures. It also aims to enhance the compositional process for instrument and live electronics, through a new way of music notation for gesturally controlled interactive systems. The system uses the Myo® armband gestural controller, a device to control live sound processing that is non-invasive to instrumental technique and performer. The combination of these elements allows the performer to experience a tangible connection between gesture and sound production. Finally, we describe the experience of Eleanor Turner, who composed and performed The Wood and the Water (Turner 2016) using MyoSpat, and we conclude by presenting the outcomes from HarpCI workshops delivered at Cardiff Metropolitan University for Camac Harp Weekend, Royal Birmingham Conservatoire’s Integra Lab and Southampton University.","2019-11-02","2023-07-12 05:17:34","2023-07-12 05:17:34","2023-07-12 05:17:30","667-686","","6","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/07494467.2019.1706351","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/6KEHANQ9/Di Donato et al. - 2019 - HarpCI, Empowering Performers to Control and Trans.pdf","","","Harp; Interactive Audio; Live Electronics; Motion Sensor; Music Performance; Sonic and Music Interaction Design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, the goal of this project was to evaluate the effectiveness of enhanced auditory menu cues in a simulated driving context. The advanced auditory cues of “spearcons” (compressed speech cues) and “spindex” (a speech-based index cue) were predicted to improve both menu navigation and driving. Two experiments used a dual task paradigm in which users selected songs on the vehicle’s infotainment system. In Experiment 1, 24 undergraduates played a simple, perceptual-motor ball-catching game (the primary task; a surrogate for driving), and navigated through an alphabetized list of 150 song titles—rendered as an auditory menu—as a secondary task. The menu was presented either in the typical visual-only manner, or enhanced with text-to-speech (TTS), or TTS plus one of three types of additional auditory cues. In Experiment 2, 34 undergraduates conducted the same secondary task while driving in a simulator. In both experiments, performance on both the primary task (success rate of the game or driving performance) and the secondary task (menu search time) was better with the auditory menus than with no sound. Perceived workload scores as well as user preferences favored the enhanced auditory cue types. These results show that adding audio, and enhanced auditory cues in particular, can allow a driver to operate the menus of in-vehicle technologies more efficiently while driving more safely. Results are discussed with multiple resources theory.","2015-01-02","2023-07-12 05:17:34","2023-07-12 05:17:34","2023-07-12 05:17:33","1-16","","1","31","","","Menu Navigation With In-Vehicle Technologies","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2014.925774","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/UP54K4E2/Jeon et al. - 2015 - Menu Navigation With In-Vehicle Technologies Audi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four modules were designed to introduce robot mechanisms as well as arts: Acting (anthropomorphism), Dance (robot movements), Music and Sounds (music composition), and Drawing (robot art). These modules provided children with basic knowledge about robotics and STEM and guided children to create a live robot theater play. A total of 16 students participated in the program, and 11 of them were involved in completing questionnaires and interviews regarding their perceptions towards robots, STEAM, and the afterschool program. Four afterschool program teachers participated in interviews, reflecting their perceptions of the program and observations of children’s experiences during the program.

When distributed around the circle, perfectly balanced rhythms and scales have their “centre of gravity” at the centre of the circle. The present article serves as a repository of the theorems and definitions crucial to perfect balance. It also further explores its mathematical ramifications by linking the existing theorems to algebraic number theory and computational optimizations.

The intent of this paper is to sufficiently delineate the space where bodily movement and abstract data have begun to intermingle across several milieu under the concept. The paper begins by contextualizing data embodiment in design, then continues by observing how choreographers have previously approached dance as data, and finishes with a case study where an environmental migration dataset is choreographed.

We us it to compose a choir of legitimacy crises in global governance from 1994 to 2014, and to negotiate a familiar divide in research on how legitimacy should be measured. Scholars predominantly prefer one of two approaches to measure legitimacy quantitatively, either looking at political trust or public contestation of political institutions. We illustrate the usefulness of sonification to subsume both positions in this divide. More generally, we argue that sonification can enhance public communication of scientific results and extract meanings from observations that go unnoticed in visual and verbal representations, in particular with relevance to describing time series data on anything from the spread of pandemics to violent conflicts and economic inequalities.","2020-07-02","2023-07-12 05:19:19","2023-07-12 05:19:19","2023-07-12 05:19:05","272-288","","3","42","","","Introducing the Sounds of Data to the Study of Politics","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/07393148.2020.1809760","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/TLQMYA9M/Agné et al. - 2020 - Introducing the Sounds of Data to the Study of Pol.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed system utilizes stereo vision, image processing methodology, and a sonification procedure to support blind mobilization. The developed system includes wearable computer, stereo cameras as vision sensor, and stereo earphones, all molded in a helmet. The image of the scene in front of the visually handicapped is captured by the vision sensors. The captured images are processed to enhance the important features in the scene in front for mobilization assistance. The image processing is designed as a model of human vision by identifying the obstacles and their depth information. The processed image is mapped onto musical stereo sound for the blind's understanding of the scene in front. The developed method has been tested in the indoor and outdoor environments and the proposed image processing methodology is found to be effective for object identification.","2008-07-18","2023-07-12 05:19:19","2023-07-12 05:19:19","2023-07-12 05:19:06","501-522","","6","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/08839510802226777","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/YQWZJ7BW/Balakrishnan and Sainarayanan - 2008 - Stereo Image Processing Procedure for Vision Rehab.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper analyses the author's work related to the group from a predominantly phenomenological perspective, and draws on authors from geography, philosophy and anthropology to interrogate the experiences of working in this way. That landscapes are dynamic and temporal phenomena is congruent with the forms of musical activity, but this congruency is not without its problems. The history of landscape study is highly visually oriented, and there is a danger of transposing assumptions from visual approaches onto the sonic. However, the paper also refuses a phonocentric approach, arguing that Ingold’s insistence on the intersensorial nature of landscape experience is essential to fully account for environmental sound art.","2018-02-17","2023-07-12 05:19:19","2023-07-12 05:19:19","2023-07-12 05:19:07","237-247","","2","43","","","Weathering","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/01426397.2016.1267719","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/U5IM86KS/Hogg - 2018 - Weathering perspectives on the Northumbrian lands.pdf","","","sound; artistic research; Improvisation; landscape; participation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Writings on ‘VJ’ culture are beginning to appear in various forums, and the number of festivals dedicated to this art form is steadily increasing, yet live media performance remains under-theorized, in part because it sits eternally in between traditional modes of production and performance and there is conjecture as to how to understand it, and in part, perhaps, simply because it remains a relatively ‘new’ form of new media. In this article I will synthesize some of the existing writings on live media and VJ culture. My overall aim through this is to suggest some answers to the question of how live media performances can be understood to make sense: not only how live media performances make sense as meaning, as conceptual sense, but also how live media performances make a new kind of perceptual sense.","2010-01-01","2023-07-12 05:19:19","2023-07-12 05:19:19","2023-07-12 05:19:08","193-208","","2","6","","","Start making sense","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1386/padm.6.2.193_1","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/IRFFBI73/Cooke - 2010 - Start making sense Live audio-visual media perfor.pdf","","","performance; real time; audio-visual; live; live cinema; new media; synaesthesia; VJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From naïve early electroacoustic experiments designed to find ‘naturalistic’ sounds in extended violin techniques, through a series of free improvisation projects, I have finally arrived at what I think of as the beginnings of a critical ecological practice with violins out in the natural environment. Dragging violins along paths, floating them in rivers, allowing rain to fall on them, and recording the results with small microphones hidden inside the bodies, I work in a participative way with the affordances of the environment, the instrument, and my own personal skills and memories. Conventional ‘soundscape’ compositions and theories of acoustic ecology can, I argue, be seen to be neither particularly acoustic, nor particularly ecosystemic. Much environmental sound art ends up being simply representation, albeit in a sonic form. Against this, I argue for participation, a refusal to hide the presence of the artist, and a resisting against the idea of merely imposing an artistic and/or aesthetic vision onto the surface of an ecosystem.

The complete muting of a soundtrack is a gesture so disruptive of the movie-going norm that filmmakers, wisely, have seldom attempted it; filmmakers seeking to depict a dramatically meaningful absence of sound have often relied extensively on a sonic presence. This essay focuses on three cinematic tropes in which the idea of silence, or “quasi-silence”, is communicated by means of sound. One of these tropes deals with “quasi silence” caused by environmental factors. Another trope, usually associated with fictional characters who experience high trauma, deals with psychologically induced “quasi silence”. The third trope, widely varied in execution yet consistent in affect, represents the point of view – or, rather, the point of audition – of filmic characters whose “quasi silence” has neurological causes.","2016-07-02","2023-07-12 05:19:19","2023-07-12 05:19:19","2023-07-12 05:19:13","137-150","","2","2","","","Narrative cinema’s “sounds of silence”","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/20551940.2016.1245012","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/5ZVWGPQT/Wierzbicki - 2016 - Narrative cinema’s “sounds of silence” variations.pdf","","","“quasi silence”; Cinema; deafness; dissociation; POA; point of audition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The participants identified the different sounds as opposed to examining their ability to identify the value of the sounds or to understand the scientific phenomena as a result of hearing the model scenario. This research found that, in regard to complexity levels, the participants were able to identify stimuli that included up to four sounds. The analyses reveal that in the second trial the participants displayed heightened ability. The long-term practical benefits of this research may well influence program developers in education and rehabilitation for people who are blind.

Informed by musicological, eco-critical, post-humanist, historical, and feminist frameworks, our analyses meander through exploratory patches employing concepts such as borderland epistemologies, interspecies connectivity, the gaze, and hyperobjectivity. These juxtapositions reveal how, rather than the sensorial experience of radioactivity as hyperobject, “SHUM” promotes ecologically attuned survival strategies such as the re-integration of “wild” singing styles and ecstatic rituals. “Survival” is understood hereby as a form of resistance that evades the pitfalls of neoliberal resilience.

To talk about body politics is therefore to talk about the technologies the body incorporates, how they probe its alleged integrity. Performance theories and practices offer a fertile ground of experimentation with this issue. Yet, there is a tendency to frame body technologies as either material extensions of one’s body or external objects one perceives with. Such approaches support technocratic systems of beliefs by eliding immaterial and pre-conscious aspects of technological incorporation, I argue. Key to this argument is the notion of automaticity; a subjective form of psychic attunement with particular technical instruments. The performativity of certain bodily thresholds enables forms of human–machine codependence, where body and technology affect each other through discipline, training and relational economies of desire. As a case study, I offer an autoethnographic analysis of my own performance with an artificially intelligent body technology. This reveals an inherently hybrid and relational corporeality, which confounds the boundaries between human and technical, material and immaterial, perceptual and psychological, conscious and pre-conscious.","2017-07-03","2023-07-12 05:21:42","2023-07-12 05:21:42","2023-07-12 05:21:25","105-119","","2","13","","","Beyond the cyborg","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/14794713.2017.1338828","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/MRTMNHD3/Donnarumma - 2017 - Beyond the cyborg performance, attunement and aut.pdf","","","performance; affect; automaticity; computation; Cyborg; hybridity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show three studies using evolutionary ecosystemic models in creative domains, demonstrating the potential for ecosystem dynamics to drive the emergence of novel behaviour. The benefits and challenges of these models are discussed, leading to a proposed framework for developing more sophisticated creative ecosystems.","2010-12-01","2023-07-12 05:21:42","2023-07-12 05:21:42","2023-07-12 05:21:26","215-231","","4","21","","","Taming nature","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/14626268.2011.550029","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/DLHACQWF/Bown and McCormack - 2010 - Taming nature tapping the creative potential of e.pdf","","","computer music; computational creativity; ecosystem; evolution; multi-agent models; niche construction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It will be demonstrated that digital media’s ability to mobilise choreography as a totalised, corporeal mode of drawing – for example in dance and movement practices – represents an avant-garde, experimental and cutting-edge terrain, in which the new technologies of inscription are gathered in innovative ways that fundamentally challenge dominant paradigms of representation.

I argue, however, that acoustic ecology as defined by Luc Ferrari and Murray Schaeffer needs refocusing or revitalizing. I suggest a framework that prioritizes community engagement, exploration, and experience of the sounding world, driven by a desire to build stewardship and agency for change management in the community. The proposed model draws on the sensibilities of acoustic ecology to drive design solutions to anthropocentric sound challenges.

The hipDisk (see Figure 1) is an interactive sonic system triggered by core-body gesture that highlights and responds to the dynamic relationship between the wearer's hip and torso. The resulting interface turns the body into an instrument by augmenting it with instrumental capabilities. hipDisk sits within a broader research framework that explores how technology can be paired with the body to poeticise experience. In order to discuss this, the process that led to the emergence of hipDisk is elaborated; this is followed by a statement of design goals; a detailed description of the instrument, its construction and behaviour; and an analysis of outcomes and audience response to date. Within this, a discussion of the role of interface, extension, tangibility, and what is afforded by the use of soft as opposed to hard electronics is undertaken. In addition, the limitations and affordances of the hipDisk as an instrument are discussed. Through this article questions are raised about the role of the creative process in the design of interactive, wearable elements and systems, and the value of considering non-functional outcomes such as addressing the inner life of the wearer. I contend that a focus on these issues can provide added value, beyond intended functionality and that, with such a focus, novel yet meaningful applications of technology could be created that poeticise experience and enhance quality of life — for. both the wearer and also, possibly, for the observer.","2008-01-01","2023-07-12 05:21:42","2023-07-12 05:21:42","2023-07-12 05:21:34","7-26","","1","4","","","hipDisk","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1386/padm.4.1.7_1","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/NHZLFXPR/Wilde - 2008 - hipDisk Using sound to encourage physical extensi.pdf","","","interaction design; wearable; body-instrument; extension; full-body interaction; gesture-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

His aim was to limit movement through design intervention to more precisely hone in on the abstract mathematics of lines and geometries created by the mediated body in space. In The Triadic Ballet (premiered 1922) for example, he analysed the restricted movements of the performing body in relation to costume’s physical material characteristics as geometrical form located on the body. While his later stage-space-architecture movement pieces (1927-1929), such as Stick Dance, scrutinised the motion of performers’ bodies as they engaged with abstract material forms in space. Altering physical movement was for Schlemmer not the only intention; he also explored the relationship of the dynamic body to the making of sound, appropriating materials with inherent percussive characteristics such as glass as new instruments of sounding (Trimingham, 2011, 146). This visual essay, concerns the use of choreosonic wearables in the devising process and explores wearable movement-sounding in interactive performance contexts. It reveals how Schlemmer’s methodologies have inspired design-in-motion explorations, both as wearable movement initiators and movement sonification systems that can stretch aspects of movement improvisation.","2019-04-03","2023-07-12 05:21:42","2023-07-12 05:21:42","2023-07-12 05:21:35","114-124","","1-2","5","","","Design-in-motion","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/23322551.2019.1603340","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/2PZ8QBUJ/Danjoux - 2019 - Design-in-motion sculpting choreosonic wearables.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The framework for this discussion is based on the Conceptual Metaphor Theory, which assumes that metaphor is a mode of thought underlying our understanding of the world around us. Accepting that metaphor is not a figure of speech, but a mode of thought, allows the investigation of metaphor underlying multimodal literacy, questioning the variability in expression of thought within and among modes, i.e. the role of transmodal metaphor, or intermedia, in knowledge building and communication.The context for evaluation is based on a collaboration and ongoing dialogue between the authors of this article in their work. Van der Elst and Ox have approached the subject of creativity and knowledge from different angles that allow Ox to revisit her work from over a decade ago from a theoretical perspective. The first part of the article describes the theoretical position emerging from these discussions. In the second part, Ox uses this thought structure to evaluate the creative process and knowledge transfer from one medium to another, which she accomplished as a practicing artist.The focus of the article is on a six-year-long production (1990–1996), Jack Ox's visualization of Kurt Schwitters' ‘Ursonate’ (Ox 1993; Hossmann and Ox 1998). By looking at one completed, extensive, creative conception, it is possible to delineate and separate two distinctly different kinds of mapping, intermedia and implicit inferences. Ox's current work in the Virtual Color Organ™ is also briefly introduced as it relates to the move into a scale-less world of virtual reality and 3D sense experience.","2011-01-01","2023-07-12 05:21:42","2023-07-12 05:21:42","2023-07-12 05:21:39","83-102","","1","10","","","How metaphor functions as a vehicle of thought","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1386/jvap.10.1.83_1","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/JSXKLSS5/Ox and Van Der Elst - 2011 - How metaphor functions as a vehicle of thought Cr.pdf","","","music visualization; Blending Theory; Conceptual Metaphor Theory; intermedia; knowledge transmission; Multimodal metaphor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The overriding ‘voice’ of Italy and its radio empire under Fascism, opera supported the new technology as a political and cultural tool, even as it challenged it as a geographical and perceptual fantasy. This article has two aims. First, drawing on materials from 1920s and ‘30s radio magazines, it sketches a history of early radio listening that restores vision and touch to a more central position than they have had in previous scholarly accounts. Second, it investigates radio and the Italian operatic voice as two mutually broadcasting technologies, ones whose critical co-construction was more than an accident of the fraught political moment. Contemporary definitions of radio as bel canto and of bel canto as radiophonic rested on a subtler, conceptual alignment between the two media, each of which foregrounded a tension between sound and meaning and implied the radial dissemination of voice ‘out’ in all directions. This article thus seeks to answer two questions. Did opera, a fundamentally audiovisual genre, become invariably ‘sonified’ through radiophonic transmission?

I first develop a typology of approaches to cartophony, before moving on to reveal the normative tendencies of online combinations of sound and mapping through an analysis of three platforms: Freesound; audioBoom; and Radio Aporee. Showing how in different ways each of these platforms supports an approach to sound mapping that favours pinning high fidelity, indexical audio-recordings to a seemingly neutral base layer, I question what is glossed over through this approach, while also considering how visual and sound-based strategies for communicating about places illuminate and resonate with one another.

Accurate placement of an electromagnetic coil on the patient’s head during repetitive TMS is the key for stimulation of the desired brain regions and positive treatment outcome. Neuronavigation systems constitute the state-of-the-art method to accurately stimulate the appropriate brain region. Local separation of navigation information and the patient anatomy in combination with intricate visualisations and cumbersome setup limits the benefits and usability of this method. The present study addresses these problems by proposing an audiovisual Augmented reality (AR) system for coil positioning during TMS. The system sonifies and visualises translational and rotational differences between a target and the current instrument position using a minimalistic graphical user interface and auditory display. Effects of cross-modal integration on usability and targeting precision were shown in an experiment comparing audiovisual AR, audio AR and visual neuronavigation. Our approach revealed significant improvements in task time of all proposed AR conditions over neuronavigation (p < 0.001). Conversely, the neuronavigation system achieved significantly better targeting accuracy (p < 0.001). A purely auditory guidance achieved comparable performance as the audiovisual interface designs.","2023-07-04","2023-07-12 05:24:29","2023-07-12 05:24:29","2023-07-12 05:24:10","1158-1165","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/21681163.2022.2154277","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/BBCTFC4S/Schütz et al. - 2023 - Audiovisual augmentation for coil positioning in t.pdf","","","augmented reality; audiovisual; human computer interaction; Multimodal interaction; surgical navigation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Symptomatic of a broader ‘turn’ to ontology in critical thought, the (re)turn to ontology in sound studies is predicated on an ‘origin myth’ that disavows ‘old’ questions of culture, signification, discourse and identity, and promotes ‘new’ questions of materiality, affectivity reality and being. This origin myth is re-articulated with the introduction of Christoph Cox’s materialist sonic philosophy, which hears the ‘richest’ sound art as giving voice to ‘the nature of the sonic’. Building on Nikki Sullivan’s notion of white optics, I suggest that Cox’s ontology is predicated upon a ‘modest’ white aurality – a racialized perceptual standpoint that is both situated and universalizing. Just as whiteness is not simply an individual trait that is possessed, white aurality is not specific to or possessed by Cox; indeed, I suggest that in Cox’s work, white aurality is partly indebted to a particular engagement with John Cage: an engagement that amplifies an apparent distinction between the social and the ontological in Cage’s work, while muffling its political dimensions. The notion of white aurality is further exemplified through the comparison on two sound works: Lawrence English’s Airport Symphony (2007) which is heard to enact a move toward sonic generality; and Chino Amobi’s Airport Music for Black Folk (2016), which, apropos of Fred Moten’s notion of blackness as paraontological disruption, is heard as sounding the racialized violence of objecthood that often goes unheard by sonic philosophy’s white aurality.","2017-07-03","2023-07-12 05:24:29","2023-07-21 08:23:44","2023-07-12 05:24:11","266-282","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/13534645.2017.1339967","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/VNKXCKR5/Thompson - 2017 - Whiteness and the Ontological Turn in Sound Studie.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Relationships within the system, or the structure, define and generate behaviours between human participant(s) and other components of an art or urban environment. While urban development and interactive art deal with participation in differing contexts and scales, the goal of the practitioner is consistent: the construction of a system that enables and maintains meaningful interaction towards some goal. The aim of this paper is to compare observations from our works at both the art-lab and urban scales, and to characterize the symbiotic relationship between user participation and system design.

These unique features beget a style of reasoning that provokes visceral memories, conveys urgency, and attunes arguers.

It takes as its central onbject of concern the shared practice that has made recent art-science collaborations so productive: their mutual interest in reimagining the possibilities of life and the body in an era in which these can be so fundamentally re-engineered, which this paper examines this under the rubric of ‘speculative biology’. The multi-disciplinary art projects examined in this paper thus invite us to reflect upon the precarity of life, during a period that finds itself at the crossroads of a rapidly increasing series of extinction and climate change events, on the one hand, and an equally rapidly accelerating scientific and technological capacity to reengineer life and living materials, on the other.","2020-11-01","2023-07-12 05:24:29","2023-07-12 05:24:29","2023-07-12 05:24:26","870-886","","6","34","","","Speculative biology","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10304312.2020.1842128","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/Y29CX49E/Stephens - 2020 - Speculative biology precarious life in art and sc.pdf","","","experimental art; art/science collaboration; Bioart; de-extinction science; Frankenstein","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The questions at the heart of it revolve around how new data technologies enable us to represent such experiences as artworks. Recent research in neuroscience has begun to establish the ways in which modes of perception are processed in the brain. Related research suggests that Synaesthesia may be caused by a genetic mutation that results in a ‘cross wiring’ of these modes of perception. Within the arts there is a long history of exploration around synaesthesia, ideas that are becoming relevant again particularly in relation to the growth in personal data. Representing sensations and transferring them from one mode to another offers a way to handle some of this data and potentially say new things about our experiences. The author explores these ideas through artworks made using data from cycling to investigate the visualization of this experience.","2019-04-03","2023-07-12 05:24:29","2023-07-12 05:24:29","2023-07-12 05:24:27","127-140","","2","30","","","Synaesthesia and cycling data art","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/14626268.2019.1615513","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/MX983Z4J/O’Neill - 2019 - Synaesthesia and cycling data art towards cross-m.pdf","","","synaesthesia; cycling; data art; Generative art","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was hypothesized that rowing with masked hearing would reduce the precision of movement, particularly at the non-usual/less-preferred stroke frequencies (SF). Self-reported questionnaires helped to understand the difficulty of the task. Twenty rowers completed 2 × 1000 m-distance-blocks, each separated into 4 × 250 m, with increasing SF 18, 20, 22 24 strokes/minute once with normal and once with masked hearing. Precision was determined as the deviation between the SF target and the SF actually performed (DSF). Athletes’ subjective perception was requested before and after the experiment. A 2 (hearing condition) × 4 (SF 18, 20, 22, 24) repeated measures ANOVA showed systematically larger DSF during masked hearing for all SFs compared to the DSF in the normal hearing condition (p < .01). Further, the highest DSFs were found for SF 18 and 24 in both hearing conditions (no interaction effect). The athletes’ perception of the relevance of natural movement sounds for their rowing performance changed when evaluated before and after the experiment. Rowing without hearing was evaluated as mentally more demanding than physically. The results confirmed our initial assumptions and showed the relevance of natural auditory information for movement precision in rowing practice, even at a high level of expertise.","2020-11-25","2023-07-12 05:24:29","2023-07-12 05:24:29","2023-07-12 05:24:28","1299-1306","","10","20","","","Sound matters","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1710265 PMID: 31903860","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/G3SU3JCH/Schaffert et al. - 2020 - Sound matters The impact of auditory deprivation .pdf","","","acoustic feedback; rowing; action perception; Elite athletes; movement timing; natural movement sounds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, the feasibility of a novel “pre-alarm” system that utilizes multisensory integration of auditory and haptic stimuli is examined as a possible solution. Methods Three vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygenation) were represented by three musically distinct sounds that were combined into soundscapes and progressed through five pre-alarm zones (very low to very high). Three haptic conditions were tested with the auditory stimulus to determine the best combination of auditory and haptic stimulation. Qualitative data was collected through surveys and the NASA TLX index. Results Alterations in frequency and timbre were most effective at transmitting information regarding changing vital sign zones with comparatively higher accuracy and quicker reaction time (RT), p <.01. The addition of haptic stimuli to the auditory soundscape caused no significant decline in study participant accuracy or RT. However, two weeks after training, participants performed the tasks significantly faster (p <.001) and felt the alarm monitoring task was significantly less cognitively demanding (p <.01), compared to the unisensory condition. Participants also felt more confident in identifying changing vital signs with the addition of haptic stimuli. Discussion The current study demonstrates that multisensory signals do not diminish the perception of transmitted information and suggest efficient training benefits over unimodal signals. Multisensory training may be beneficial over time compared to unisensory training due to a stronger consolidation effect. The potential integration of haptic input with existing auditory alarm systems and training is supported.","2019-10-02","2023-07-12 05:26:40","2023-07-12 05:26:40","2023-07-12 05:26:25","188-206","","4","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/25742442.2020.1773194","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/DMEU443C/Burdick et al. - 2019 - Using Multisensory Haptic Integration to Improve M.pdf","","","haptic; alarm; alarm fatigue; Multisensory integration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Real-time feedback from wearables can reduce discontinuation by reducing injury risk and improving performance and motivation. There are however several limitations and challenges with current real-time feedback approaches. We discuss these limitations and challenges and provide a framework to optimise real-time feedback for reducing injury risk and improving performance and motivation. We first discuss the reasons why individuals run and propose that feedback targeted to these reasons can improve motivation and compliance. Secondly, we review the association of running technique and running workload with injuries and performance and we elaborate how real-time feedback on running technique and workload can be applied to reduce injury risk and improve performance and motivation. We also review different feedback modalities and motor learning feedback strategies and their application to real-time feedback. Briefly, the most effective feedback modality and frequency differ between variables and individuals, but a combination of modalities and mixture of real-time and delayed feedback is most effective. Moreover, feedback promoting perceived competence, autonomy and an external focus can improve motivation, learning and performance. Although the focus is on wearables, the challenges and practical applications are also relevant for laboratory-based gait retraining.","2020-01-17","2023-07-12 05:26:40","2023-07-12 05:26:40","2023-07-12 05:26:27","214-230","","2","38","","","Real-time feedback by wearables in running","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2019.1690960 PMID: 31795815","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/T3W7L2YP/Van Hooren et al. - 2020 - Real-time feedback by wearables in running Curren.pdf","","","Framework; running; gait-retraining; motor learning; personalised; sports watch","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we present a reading of one of audio erotica's most popular genres: the male-for-female (M4F) boyfriend experience (BFE). The BFE's codes and conventions immerse the implied female listener in an eroticized domestic fantasy in which she is being taken care of by a man. The BFE cocoons listeners in an intimate audio encounter with a fantasy man who is defined by his capacity to engage in eroticized caretaking practices. We argue that these sonic scenes of eroticized masculine care and domesticity present an opportunity to understand contemporary notions of (and trends in) ‘porn for women’.

The exhibition The Blind Astronomer (2013) by South African artist Berco Wilsenach participated in this larger critique of visuality by inviting audiences to engage with the works through the sense of touch. In particular, the artworks exposed the limitations of the spectatorial epistemology of modern Western scientific discourse. In this article, I explore some of the ways in which the exhibition questioned long-held assumptions about the primacy of vision in Western science and aesthetics, the relationship between touch and vision, and touch as an aesthetic experience. The eviction of touch from the gallery and museum as well as from what is considered to count as aesthetic experience has led to an absence of language adequate to describing the complex nature of aesthetic touch. I suggest that first-hand accounts of blind peoples’ haptic experiences with art, combined with insights gained from research in psychology as well as experiments by artists who encourage tactile encounters with their work can enrich and enhance how we understand an aesthetic experience that is simultaneously visual and tactile.","2019-10-02","2023-07-12 05:26:40","2023-07-12 05:26:40","2023-07-12 05:26:35","323-341","","4","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/14702029.2019.1680510","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/VT7V38CQ/Lauwrens - 2019 - Touch as an aesthetic experience.pdf","","","blindness; tactile aesthetics; The Blind Astronomer; Touch","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This discipline is of interest to human–computer interaction (HCI) specialists concerned with finding out about users’ mental models and representing these in user interfaces. Central to cognitive linguistics are the theories of conceptual metaphor and image schemas. These theories have been influential in two areas of HCI: generating population stereotypes of physical-to-abstract mappings and inspiring user interface designs. The article reviews the theory and research into the application of image schemas and image-schematic metaphors in HCI. Special emphasis is put on strategies of image-schema sourcing. The theory and the available evidence suggest that the application of image schemas can contribute to user interfaces that are innovative, inclusive, and intuitive to use. The claim for inclusiveness currently has the weakest empirical support and needs to be substantiated by further research.","2017-01-02","2023-07-12 05:26:40","2023-07-12 05:26:40","2023-07-12 05:26:36","1-20","","1","33","","","How Cognitive Linguistics Inspires HCI","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2016.1232227","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/2CDIMYS3/Hurtienne - 2017 - How Cognitive Linguistics Inspires HCI Image Sche.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The article explores how the specificity of “thinking-in-action” cultivated within improvisatory live coding relates to the embodied “thought-in-motion” activated whilst working on the loom. Echoing the wider concerns of Weaving Codes/Coding Weaves, an attempt is made to redefine the relation between weave and code by dislodging the dominant utilitarian histories that connect computer and the loom, instead placing emphasis on the potentially resistant and subversive forms of live thinking-and-knowing cultivated within live coding and ancient weaving. Cocker addresses the Penelopean poetics of both practices, proposing how the combination of kairotic timing and timeliness with the mêtic act of “doing-undoing-redoing” therein offers a subversive alternative to—even critique of—certain utilitarian technological developments (within both coding and weaving) which in privileging efficiency and optimization can delimit creative possibilities, reducing the potential of human intervention and invention in the seizing of opportunity, accident, chance and contingency.","2017-04-03","2023-07-12 05:29:07","2023-07-12 05:29:07","2023-07-12 05:28:49","124-141","","2","15","","","Weaving Codes/Coding Weaves","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/14759756.2017.1298233","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/Q7MX85JX/Cocker - 2017 - Weaving CodesCoding Weaves Penelopean Mêtis and .pdf","","","live coding; kairos; mêtis; Penelope; technē; thinking-in-action","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Distillery: Waveforming is an increment in Khut's long running and ongoing biofeedback project. Khut is interested in body-focused interactive art and design, and has described himself as a ‘practice based researcher’. He embeds his art practice within research frameworks and utilises objective methodologies to model and evaluate his practice. Distillery: Waveforming is an interactive, sensory artwork at the heart of which is the human experience. Distillery: Waveforming incorporates the use of an iPad software application (app) called BrightHearts that at the time of acquisition was in a developmental stage. Prior to acquisition it was necessary to resolve issues relating to the ongoing management of an artwork that was essentially a prototype. Distillery: Waveforming is an ensemble of parts incorporating tablet technology in the form of Apple iPads that were loaded with the prototype BrightHearts app, and external data collection, processing and relaying equipment. In order to safeguard the independent operation of the iPad devices and the prototype BrightHearts application, the Gallery undertook iOS device jailbreaking, essentially disengaging the iPads from their proprietary restrictions to allow for greater user control. With the assistance of the artist, QAGOMA has compiled a comprehensive digital archive and strategies for representing and reinterpreting Distillery: Waveforming in the future. The artwork has been recognised as an important legacy acquisition and as a consequence the artist and the Gallery's new media conservator have considered strategies that will allow the artwork to be displayed in alternate modes which achieve an aesthetic authenticity that meets the artist's intent.","2015-06-01","2023-07-12 05:29:07","2023-07-12 05:29:07","2023-07-12 05:28:54","67-75","","1","36","","","Life Beyond Legacy","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1179/0313538115Y.0000000005","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/MNNZKLQE/Pagliarino - 2015 - Life Beyond Legacy George Poonhkin Khut's Distill.pdf","","","app; Installation; Apple; Digital; iOS devices; iPad; iTunes; Legacy; New media","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By insulating the experiment from tacit or embodied knowledge, it is expected to produce more reliable output. This apparent tension between trustworthy disembodied protocols and the unreliable human factor should not, however, be taken at face value. Instrument operators routinely face uncertainties and instrument opacity, and their concerns may be further aggravated when processes are automated. In some contexts, therefore, researchers cultivate such embodied practices precisely to assure themselves of the reliability of automated instruments and protocols. This qualitative study of research practice in a multi-disciplinary research group in physics and materials science shows that researchers complement instrument readings with ‘somatic vigilance’, a set of laboratory practices that emphasize hands-on instrument knowledge, material witnessing and rely on sensory experience to monitor experimental processes. Equating physical and epistemic proximity to an instrument, operators use these techniques to monitor their instruments and to manage their own expectations. Operators’ reliance on auditory information and sonic skills to monitor their instruments and their environment illustrates the value of somatic vigilance on the laboratory’s work-floor. Connecting scholarship in science and technology studies on trust management and embodied practice, somatic vigilance calls attention to the continuous maintenance of both instruments and user expectations as well as the situated and often embodied techniques that are required to manage trust in instruments. More than an unreliable human factor, it suggests that researchers instead, conversely, consider embodied knowledge a way to fix automation.","2020-07-02","2023-07-12 05:29:07","2023-07-12 05:29:07","2023-07-12 05:28:58","450-473","","3","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/09505431.2019.1688780","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/H3YRX6M9/Bruyninckx - 2020 - Somatic Vigilance and Sonic Skills in Experimental.pdf","","","body; experimental physics; senses; Trust; vigilance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper describes the participatory design process that was undertaken over a two-year period, involving key informants and stakeholders, including teachers, docents (specialist museum guides) and curators. The designers also explored the potential of ubiquitous computing to enhance children's interpretive experience in museums, and this is also described. The research reported in this paper was supported within the EU disappearing computer (DC) initiative, specifically the SHAPE project. The goal of SHAPE, Situating Hybrid Assemblies in Public Environments, was to explore how emerging, novel computer technologies could be deployed in public spaces to enhance interaction and learning. The project culminated in the deployment of an innovative, large-scale computer-augmented exhibition, Re-Tracing the Past, in the Hunt Museum. This novel exhibition was open to the public from 9 to 19 June 2003. This paper documents the design process from initial scenario elaboration through to final deployment of novel technology in the museum. Evaluation data are also discussed, and the paper concludes with some insights for participatory design of technology to enhance children's interaction in museums.

Writers who identify themselves as part of this ‘regional literary establishment’ [chihō bundan] have engaged in a sustained process of reflexively performing and defining their place-consciousness. Processes of localization are enacted in a wide variety of forms, particularly through the invocation of vernacular language, place-specific knowledge, and ideological discourse. This paper explores the conceptual writings of Fukushi Kōjirō (1889–1946) and the ‘dialect’ [hōgen] works of Takagi Kyōzō (1903–87), among others, bringing these influential and important – yet strongly marginalized – Japanese literary figures further into the purview of English-language scholarship. It analyzes Fukushi’s ‘regionalism’ [chihō shugi], its central concept of ‘spirit’ [seishin, tamashii], and the related invocation of place-based practices like ‘Tsugaru esprit’ and ‘godagu’ [bullshitting]. It then places Takagi’s strategic deployment of vernacular speech and localized folk knowledge within the context of that discourse in order to elucidate the active and intentional construction of Tsugaru within the local literary landscape. These writers move against the centralizing and homogenizing discourses of modernization theory, and provide a refreshing vantage for rethinking place and place-consciousness in modern Japan.","2019-01-02","2023-07-12 05:29:07","2023-07-12 05:29:07","2023-07-12 05:29:02","95-113","","1","39","","","Fantastic Placeness","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10371397.2019.1588692","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/MVHCMLB3/Solomon - 2019 - Fantastic Placeness Fukushi Kōjirō’s Regionalism .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although providing nonvisual access is now routine for many forms of linear information, it becomes more difficult as the structure of the information becomes increasingly nonlinear. An understanding of the ways in which graphs benefit sighted people, based on experiments and the literature, together with the difficulties encountered when exploring graphs nonvisually, helps form a solution for nonvisual access to graphs. This article proposes that differing types of annotation offer a powerful and flexible technique for transferring the benefits of graph-based diagrams, as well as for reducing disorientation while moving around the graph and for tackling some of the inherent disadvantages of using sound. Different forms of annotation that may address these problems are explored, classified, and evaluated, including notes designed to summarise and to aid node differentiation. Graph annotation may be performed automatically, creating a graph that evaluation shows requires less mental effort to explore and on which tasks can be achieved more effectively and more efficiently.","2013-05-01","2023-07-12 05:29:07","2023-07-12 05:29:07","2023-07-12 05:29:03","193-221","","3","28","","","Making Graph-Based Diagrams Work in Sound","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/07370024.2012.697010","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/KXJFADKQ/Brown et al. - 2013 - Making Graph-Based Diagrams Work in Sound The Rol.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While serving the political aims of Louis-Philippe, the mural echoes imagery of Saint-Simonist poetry in which the steam machine is seen as a key to international unity. The article explores these connections together with the darker aspects of machine imagery, contemporary reactions to Vernet's mural, and the problem of political allegory in the aftermath of the Revolution of 1848.","1984-06-01","2023-07-12 05:29:07","2023-07-12 05:29:07","2023-07-12 05:29:07","254-269","","2","66","","","Horace Vernet's Mural in the Palais Bourbon","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00043079.1984.10788159","","","","","Correction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
