It is an information transmission process which can be described through the Shannon-Weaver Theory of Mathematical Communication. Musical borrowing is proposed as a method in sonification which can aid the information transmission process as the composer’s and listener’s shared musical knowledge is used. This article describes the compositional process of Wasgiischwashäsch (2017) which uses Rossini’s William Tell Overture (1829) to sonify datasets relating to climate change in Switzerland. It concludes that the familiarity of audiences with the original piece, and the humorous effect produced by the distortion of a well-known piece, contribute to a more effective transmission process.","2019-08","2023-07-10 08:10:48","2023-07-10 08:10:48","2023-07-10 08:10:48","184-194","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/X32U7CKQ/Bonet - 2019 - Musical Borrowing in Sonification.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its setup, in which the brain waves of a solo performer are made to excite percussion instruments, has given the work a central place in the discourse on artistic sonification. However, only a small number of the authors making reference to the work seem to have studied the score, and even fewer have given thought to the score's implications for performance practice and aesthetic reflection. This paper pays detailed attention to these yet overlooked aspects, drawing on accounts of early performances as well as the authors’ participation in a 2012 performance led by the composer.

Current telematic electroacoustic music practice, despite the distances involved, is largely embedded in older music/sonic arts paradigms. For example, it is dominated by using concert halls, by concerns about the relationship between people and machines, and by concerns about geographically distributed cultures and natural environments. A more suitable environment for telematic sonic works is found in the inter-relationship between ‘players’ and broader contemporary networked life – one embedded in multiple real-time informational data streams. These streams will increase rapidly with the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), and with the increasing deployment of algorithmic decision-making and machine learning software. While collated data streams, such as news feeds, are often rendered visually, they are also partly interpreted through embodied cognition that is similar to music and sonic art interpretation. A meeting point for telematic electroacoustic music and real-time data sonification is in affective composition/performance models and data sonification. These allow for the sonic exploration of participants’ place in a matrix of increasingly networked relationships.","2015-04","2023-07-10 08:10:48","2023-07-10 08:10:48","2023-07-10 08:10:48","90-98","","1","20","","","Developing Telematic Electroacoustic Music","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/Q5EZ6L6C/Whalley - 2015 - Developing Telematic Electroacoustic Music Comple.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of data sonification techniques within media archaeology to facilitate the organisation of sound is briefly discussed. A framework is presented for utilising data sonification to facilitate the organisation of sound within the lens of media archaeology inquiry. Such an approach provides a novel method in media archaeologically informed sound-based art that utilises the sound of the artefact as a method of expression between genealogically related forms of media.

However, it is known to be unreliable when used for detecting information in some types of data. This is generally thought to be the result of the co-dependency of the psychoacoustic dimensions used in the mapping.Positing its perceptual basis in a theory of embodied cognition, the most common approach to overcoming this limitation involves techniques that afford the interactive exploration of the data using gross body gestures. In some circumstances, such exploration is not possible and, even when it is, it may be neither necessary nor sufficient.This article explores some other possible reasons for the unreliability of parameter mapping sonification and, drawing from the experience of expressive musical performance, suggests that the problem lies not in the parametric approach per se, nor in the lack of interactivity, but in the extent to which the parameters employed contribute to coherent gestalts. A method for how this might be achieved that relies on the use of micro-gestural information is proposed. While this is speculative, the use of such gestural inflections is well known in music performance, is supported by findings in neuroscience and lends itself to empirical testing.","2014-04","2023-07-10 08:10:48","2023-07-10 08:10:48","2023-07-10 08:10:48","52-59","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/2NZQ8LBV/Worrall - 2014 - Can Micro-Gestural Inflections Be Used to Improve .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is often described in scientific terms as a means of uncovering previously unknown patterns in information or data through the use of the auditory sense. This goal seems to be objective, but the results and methodologies can be highly subjective. Moreover, the techniques and sources of information are strikingly similar to those used in mysticism, especially mysticisms of negation, even though the frames of reference and underlying perceptions of the world are markedly different. Both practitioners of sonification and apophatic mystics believe that certain types of information are incomprehensible through traditional analytic means and can only be understood through experience. In this way, sonification can be thought of as a source of mystical information.In this paper, I will discuss the similarities between sonification and apophatic mysticism, or the mysticism of negation. I will argue that the practice of sonification, as a source of mystical information, is ideally suited for creative contemplation, particularly in electronic music. I will start by providing some historical background on the mysticism of negation. I will then present several ways in which sonified knowledge (sound) is often imagined, discussed and perceived akin to a mystical object. Finally, I will discuss specific ways in which sonification exemplifies apophatic mysticism and reveals mystical information. This information – whatever its nature – can be used for creative contemplation and is a potentially invaluable source of compositional and spiritual inspiration.","2014-12","2023-07-10 08:10:48","2023-07-10 08:10:48","2023-07-10 08:10:48","304-309","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/UNH8K88X/Wolfe - 2014 - Sonification and the Mysticism of Negation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It describes ways in which two theoretically distant categories of art music, namely, electroacoustic music and the concert-hall tradition, may converge given the emergent societal and technological shifts in the information age. The concepts of ‘networks’ and ‘reciprocity’, as developed by sociologists Manuel Castells and Marcel Mauss, respectively, constitute the theoretical lens for this analysis, which sees a number of musicological notions, including ‘musical society’ and ‘acousmatics’ reconsidered philosophically. Emphasis is placed, in lieu of the insular methodologies associated with the akousmatikoi, on broader Pythagorean society, its mythical links with present-day musical society, which are explored in relation to practical as well as structural proclivities permeating contemporary art music. These philosophical considerations are then used, so as to provide a general theory of récit music, a musical form designed by the author enabling creative employment of the impasses introduced in the information age. Finally, different reciprocities of the form with contemporary and traditional compositional philosophies are discussed, serving as an overview of the various theoretical and formal facets of récit music as methodology, approached in terms of three propositions.","2023-04","2023-07-10 08:10:48","2023-07-10 08:10:48","2023-07-10 08:10:48","78-87","","1","28","","","Récit Music","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/7YQ99HT7/Fallah - 2023 - Récit Music Musical community in the information .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Today there are two striking manifestations of this work: the increasing globalisation of the electroacoustic community, and the increasing sophistication of digital techniques applied to soundscape composition. In addition, the tradition of listening to environmental soundscapes as if they were music is inverted to suggest listening to electroacoustic music as if it were soundscape. What analytical tools and insights would result? The theoretical concepts introduced in soundscape studies and acoustic communication are summarised and applied first to media and digital gaming environments, noting the extensions of both their sound worlds and the related listening attitudes they provoke in terms of analytical and distracted listening. Traditional approaches to acousmatic and soundscape analysis are compared for their commonalities and differences, the latter being mainly their relative balance of attention towards inner and outer complexity. The types of electroacoustic music most amenable to a soundscape based analysis are suggested, along with brief examples of pieces to which such analysis might be directed.","2008-08","2023-07-10 08:10:48","2023-07-10 08:10:48","2023-07-10 08:10:48","103-109","","2","13","","","Soundscape Composition as Global Music","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/V74BHNX3/Truax - 2008 - Soundscape Composition as Global Music Electroaco.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Throughout almost all the twentieth century, musical practices continued to be expressed by a system of cultural mediations that proved to be a practical impediment to the emergence of non-conventional cultures. Electronic music in particular and its corrosive tendencies, though spread and supported by remarkable composers, has ended up being devoured by academic immune systems. Now that the diffusion of Net computing has induced people to intervene in musical material, a poetics based on interference is spreading. By gaining ground on grammatical and self-referenced poetics, this trend has gradually become a palpable fact and music perceives itself as both individual writing and a production of social meaning. At present, a globe-net-transfer of sound material passes through different contexts and spaces, and seems to be adapting itself to different social speeds. Through the Net we can, on the one hand, replace, manipulate and recontextualise musical parameters until a different significance emerges; at the same time, randomising and hybridising musical objects can partially change our perception of the same musical events. On the other hand, music online databases, audio browsers and musical queries may open the way to overthrowing, reorganising and personalising music description. This could occur at different levels and to different degrees of complexity, both as a social event and as an active, user-based combination of musical structures.","2001-08","2023-07-10 08:10:48","2023-07-10 08:10:48","2023-07-10 08:10:48","111-115","","2","6","","","Music negotiation","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/TNYRWJ42/Tanzi - 2001 - Music negotiation routes in user-based descriptio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It combines the strategies and traditions of electronic media-related music composition of the twentieth century, like reproductive music, electronic music, computer music and Net music in a single, digital, multi-purpose device originally designed for business and multimedia applications. Consequently, what we hear is mostly not a genuine laptop music, but one facet of the information-technological transformation of music that has been the result of the digital integration of these established traditions. This article gives an overview of the aesthetic implications of these traditions and with respect to laptop performance and musical style.","2008-04","2023-07-10 08:10:48","2023-07-10 08:10:48","2023-07-10 08:10:48","5-11","","1","13","","","The tip of the iceberg","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/K62LWLSG/Grossmann - 2008 - The tip of the iceberg laptop music and the infor.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Music in flat form means music that avoids obvious or dimensionally conjunct large-scale goals, points of arrival, ‘climaxes’, sectional boundaries, and the like, and therefore has proven difficult for many listeners. It has become clear to me that this music demands a different listening approach, one at odds with the way music is typically appreciated in the concert hall. This approach is one that composers of music in flat form can facilitate through today's computer-music resources. What I present here is a specific instance of such an approach: my composition Sand, a twenty-five-minute long work for computer-synthesised and processed sounds, was composed specifically to be experienced through a computer-music interface I built in the MAX/MSP environment. This paper explores what I mean by ‘flatness’, how I came to terms with it as a listener, and how this coming-to-terms spawned the idea and construction of the interface. I then discuss the interface itself, the process of interaction with the listener, and technical aspects of the software.","2004-12","2023-07-10 08:12:23","2023-07-10 08:12:23","2023-07-10 08:12:23","243-250","","3","9","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/DFHYZ7WP/Bailey - 2004 - An interface for ‘flat music’.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evoke the notion of the Music One Participates In, which focuses on a shift from the listener-as-consumer to participant-actor actively engaged in sound perception and production. We look at the range of different methods that make up the term ‘workshop’, as well as emergent relationships between facilitator and participant in creative do-it-yourself activities to frame our discussion of participatory music practice. We then examine the nature of participation across a range of disciplines from social and cognitive science through human computer interaction to radical and contemporary art, and identify possible contradictions in horizontal utopian organisational models. With this conceptual frame as a backdrop, we present four types of workshop that we have conducted across time at different sites with diverse groups of participants. We apply concepts from the participation literature to analyse our music workshops, and attempt to reconcile the potentially diverging agendas of facilitator and participant to arrive at a process-based view of ‘workshopping’.","2013-12","2023-07-10 08:12:23","2023-07-10 08:12:23","2023-07-10 08:12:23","282-291","","3","18","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/GWEEKJ5L/Jo et al. - 2013 - Workshopping Participation in Music.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This stems from the roots of acousmatic philosophy in phenomenology and a steady focus on our experience of the world around us. Importantly, this points simultaneously towards rhythmic qualities of our environment and towards rhythmic qualities of our embodied experience of that world, due to rhythmic aspects of our bodies, our perception and our cognitive faculties.","2020-08","2023-07-10 08:12:23","2023-07-10 08:12:23","2023-07-10 08:12:23","214-220","","2","25","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/LRTW9XAY/Andean - 2020 - Rhythm in Acousmatic Music.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Emphasis shifts between these two layers, and they interact to construct further layers of meaning. In his book Sweet Anticipation: Music and the Psychology of Expectation, David Huron proposes that our responses to musical stimuli are in fact identical to our responses to real-world stimuli, and follow the same processes. This appears to negate somewhat the dichotomy of musical and narrative layers.

Yet the individuals who participate in these social groups may not even be aware of the structures that they are creating. Almost certainly, these structures emerge through the application of simple, local interactions. Improvised music is an uncertain activity, characterised by a lack of top-down organisation and busy, local activity between improvisers. Emerging structures may only be perceivable at a (temporal) distance. The development of higher-level musical structure arises from interactions at lower levels, and we propose here that the self-organisation of social animals provides a very suggestive analogy. This paper builds a model of interactivity based on stigmergy, the process by which social insects communicate indirectly by environment modification. The improvisational element of our model arises from the dynamics of a particle swarm. A process called interpretation extracts musical parameters from the aural environment, and uses these parameters to place attractors in the environment of the swarm, after which stigmergy can take place. The particle positions are reinterpreted as parameterised audio events.

It deconstructs the belief that the meaning of music lies within its structure. This represents only one half of the equation, while the other half embodies the notion that music is ultimately intended to be listened to by subjective human beings who will interpret the music in different ways. The meaning is not located in the musical object (the piece), nor is it exclusively in the mind of the perceiver (human), but rather lies in the relationship between the two. Furthermore, this paper proposes that there are no objective aspects of music at all. To support this claim, the author uses the latest research from neuroscience, cognitive psychology and neo-Darwinism. Analysing the pitfalls of the modernist world view and the structure-based music that it has produced, the author proposes postmodern methods for the survival of computer music.

Music-oriented researchers in the fields of psychoacoustics and cognition in recent years have viewed the computer as a means of simply extending and rationalising traditional music theory and form, rather than summarising the base of musical knowledge we have inherited and then breaking free of those constraints. Performers, composers and producers in the field of popular entertainment continue to use technology to narrow rather than broaden aesthetic boundaries in the so-called creative arts.A new aesthetic paradigm is needed . . . Technology provides us with the tools we require in order to build a genuinely new method of music creation and listening. I propose that it is time to invest our energies in the creation of visionary learning tools that enhance our ability to evolve in our relationship to ourselves, to one another, to the planet, and perhaps ultimately to the stars. It is the author’s strongest desire to allow for the full realisation of what computer music has long held the promise to provide – limitless variation with infinite control.Toward this end, I document here (i) a theory of music that attempts to assimilate the infinite and subtle interconnectedness of the human experience into a single symbolic structure, and (ii) the application of this theory to the extension of an emerging genre – the environmentally interactive computer music system – designed for eventual use by people not necessarily aware of the underlying technical and aesthetic principles at work, but fully appreciative of the profound personal benefits to be found embedded therein.Owing to space limitations, I will focus almost exclusively on the theoretical and aesthetic issues that have driven the software development, and leave a detailed discussion of the system specifications and its operation to a separate article.","1998-04","2023-07-10 08:12:23","2023-07-10 08:12:23","2023-07-10 08:12:23","3-16","","1","3","","","Music In The Air","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/D2VWIM7L/Newcomb - 1998 - Music In The Air a theoretical model and software.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How did the first experiments become a School and produce so many rich works? As this issue of Organised Sound addresses various aspects of the GRM activities throughout sixty years of musical adventure, this article discusses the musical thoughts behind the advent and the development of the music created and theoretised at the Paris School formed by the Schaefferian endeavours. Particular attention is given to the early twentieth-century conceptions of musical sounds and how poets, artists and musicians were expressing their quest for, as Apollinaire put it, ‘new sounds new sounds new sounds’. The questions of naming, gesture, sound capture, processing and diffusion are part of the concepts thoroughly revisited by the GRMC, then the GRM in 1958, up to what is known as acousmatic music. Other contributions, such as Teruggi's, give readers insight into the technical environments and innovations that took place at the GRM. This present article focuses on the remarkable unity of the GRM. This unity has existed alongside sixty years of activity and dialogue with researchers of other fields and constant attention to the latter-day scientific, technological and philosophical ideas which have had a strong influence in shaping the development of GRM over the course of its history.","2007-12","2023-07-10 08:12:23","2023-07-10 08:12:23","2023-07-10 08:12:23","189-202","","3","12","","","What the GRM brought to music","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/GU5M7E5M/Battier - 2007 - What the GRM brought to music from musique concrè.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this way has arisen a welter of terms that, however expressive of nuance, have precluded evaluation of the phenomenon as such. This is in part a consequence of general disregard for the fact that to conceive of musical borrowing entails correlative concepts, all of which precondition it, yet none self-evidently. Further preclusive of clarity, the musico-analytic lens of borrowing is typically invoked only in counterpoint to a quintessentially Western aesthetic category of composition ex nihilo. As a consequence, the fundamental role played by borrowing in musical domains situated at the periphery of the Western art music tradition, specifically pre-modern polyphony and twentieth-century musique concrète, has been overlooked. This article seeks to bridge such lacunae in our understanding of musical borrowing via phenomenological investigation into its conceptual and historical foundations. A more comprehensive evaluation of musical borrowing, one capable of accounting for its diverse instantiations while simultaneously disclosing what makes all of them ‘borrowings’ in the first place, is thereby attainable.","2019-08","2023-07-10 08:12:23","2023-07-10 08:12:23","2023-07-10 08:12:23","174-183","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/DX5BGW9Q/Hallowell - 2019 - Towards a Phenomenology of Musical Borrowing.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

My hypothesis is that in order to do this we must focus on the traits of sound sculpture connecting it to music rather than on those separating the two. A useful instrument to analyse this connection is Harry Partch’s concept of corporeal music. In contrast to Western classical music, which he viewed as abstract and devoid of life, Partch envisioned a music that would emphasise the physicality of sound-making and engage the listener on a more visceral level. Investigating a number of works from all parts of the sound sculpture spectrum, I argue that all the various practices that comprise the art form present the core traits of Partch’s musical ideal (physicality of music, audience engagement, and unity of the sonic and the visual) to a substantial extent. Analysing sound sculpture in light of its connection to music brings to the fore a number of musical issues for which this new art form provides a new perspective. Among these are the agency of the composer and the listener, the function and nature of a score, as well as the role of technology in music-making. These issues, along with the general idea of corporeality of music, compose a discourse that transcends the boundaries of different subgenres of sound sculpture, allowing for theorisation of the art form as a whole.","2015-08","2023-07-10 08:13:20","2023-07-10 08:13:20","2023-07-10 08:13:20","182-190","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/SIABX8KI/Keylin - 2015 - Corporeality of Music and Sound Sculpture.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Actuated musical instruments are physical instruments that have been endowed with virtual qualities controlled by a computer in real-time but which are nevertheless tangible. These instruments provide intuitive and engaging new forms of interaction. They are different from traditional (acoustic) and fully automated (robotic) instruments in that they produce sound via vibrating element(s) that are co-manipulated by humans and electromechanical systems. We examine the possibilities that arise when such instruments are played in different performative environments and music-making scenarios, and we postulate that such designs may give rise to new methods of musical performance. The Haptic Drum, the Feedback Resonance Guitar, the Electromagnetically Prepared Piano, the Overtone Fiddle and Teleoperation with Robothands are described, along with musical examples and reflections on the emergent properties of the performance ecologies that these instruments enable. We look at some of the conceptual and perceptual issues introduced by actuated musical instruments, and finally we propose some directions in which such research may be headed in the future.","2011-08","2023-07-10 08:13:20","2023-07-10 08:13:20","2023-07-10 08:13:20","154-165","","2","16","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/XT5AAYSM/Overholt et al. - 2011 - Advancements in Actuated Musical Instruments.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The auditory system has evolved to seek the reasons for the soundfield it encounters and this property cannot meaningfully be ignored by composers in this medium. The acousmatic condition stimulates and enhances this response. The science of acoustics cannot any longer alone explain sound phenomena and requires psychological and ecological dimensions. The idea of the ‘frame’ is developed from large-scale to small-scale soundfields: ‘landscape’, ‘arena’ and ‘stage’ are seen to be flexible components of this approach to composition.

In particular, the author's Smalltalk music object kernel (Smoke) music representation language is described and examples given that illustrate the most important of Smoke's features.","1996-04","2023-07-10 08:13:20","2023-07-10 08:13:20","2023-07-10 08:13:21","56-68","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/UZKTJ84U/Pope - 1996 - Object-oriented music representation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Beginning with an overview of imitation in music and then recapping the critical work advanced by Kofi Agawu and Jean-Jacques Nattiez on musical semiology, this article first delves into how musical signs are interpreted and propagated within participatory settings. Subsequently, using Jürgen Habermas’s influential theory on the public sphere as well as the critical revisions to said theory proposed by Nancy Fraser and Michael Warner, participatory musics are conceptualised as constituting the formal space of a public in which the aesthetic direction of a participatory music work is negotiated among participants. Based on an analysis of Luke Dahl, Jorge Herrera and Carr Wilkerson’s multi-user instrument and participatory work TweetDreams, this article discusses the ways in which participant inputs and choices impact the poietic process of the work due to the clear rules that are set up within its interactive and algorithmic protocols for sonification. It concludes by pointing towards other recent research on participatory works, where the framing of participatory musics as a political–aesthetic space leads to broader questions about audience power and how the latter is negotiated and shared, then poses questions for future research on the audience’s choice in refusal and dissensus.","2023-04","2023-07-10 08:13:20","2023-07-10 08:13:20","2023-07-10 08:13:21","53-63","","1","28","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/TZJIIC2L/Lemmon - 2023 - The Politics of Aesthetic Preference in Participat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Precise analytical terminology is established, and the methodology of environmental history is used to assess Western understandings about the role and place of music. Origins and ideas regarding immersive space, emotive power and the development of dualistic ‘nature–culture’ schemas are explored. Impacts of key developments in twentieth-century technology and environmental thought are examined as they relate to electroacoustic research. Biomusicology is reviewed for insights into innate musical structures and possibilities, and a recent linguistic study is analysed from a musical perspective to advance a cross-disciplinary argument: music may represent a form of mitigational behaviour used to balance the evolutionary tradeoff that enabled modern language. This argument suggests that if music in itself represents an environment critical for human mental health, then the contribution of electroacoustic music is vital for fresh eco-critical debate and awareness, and that an increased musical practice, especially in participatory contexts, may be essential for the human project.","2012-12","2023-07-10 08:13:20","2023-07-10 08:13:20","2023-07-10 08:13:21","240-247","","3","17","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/4FRF4QWT/Bocast - 2012 - Examining the Place of Music in Western Eco-cosmol.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The concept of ‘failed histories’ is introduced here with three important examples. The first chronicles the career of electromusical innovator Johann Baptist Schalkenbach (1824–1910). The second example examines Britain’s earliest electronic sound performance in 1895, signalling a rupture between electromusical bombast and the detailed, quiet work of the experimental laboratory. The third episode looks at the wireless oscillation outrages of the 1920s and 1930s, where electronic tone prematurely trespassed upon musical culture. Taken together, these failed histories offer an alternative narrative of electronic music finding its voice (and losing its voice) in turn-of-the-century Britain.","2017-08","2023-07-10 08:13:20","2023-07-10 08:13:20","2023-07-10 08:13:21","150-160","","2","22","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/W2WI6MIG/Wilson - 2017 - Failed Histories of Electronic Music.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Doing-it-together (DIT) and the idea of community and shared experiences are at the root of DIY practice. This article discusses how the workshop and the event have become central to practitioners working in the field of DIY. Collective instrument building, the concept of the living installation, and performance are viewed as a holistic event. Some specific examples of the author's work known as Dirty Electronics are considered, where emphasis is placed upon experience rather than the ‘something to take home’ factor. These include the following works: ICA Solder a Score, Noise Shadow, Still and Cut & Thrust. Composing ‘outside’ electronics is regarded as a method for revealing processes that can be represented in other areas of the work beyond sound-generating circuits. The article also looks at how building circuits and sound devices acts as a way to create a tabula rasa, and how the idea of delegated performance, where instruments are played by ‘non-experts’, serves to establish a naïve approach and authenticity in performance. Through the sharing of information online and in workshops, the DIY community has become knowledgeable, which has resulted in a community ‘full of experts’ and the growth of custom-designed circuits. The rise of discrete hand-held music players, such as the Buddha Machine, and the boutique synthesiser are also discussed, and the physical artefact and sound object are seen as a vehicle for the dissemination of ideas. Finally, the question is asked: ‘In DIY practice, where does the authentic document of the work lie?’","2013-12","2023-07-10 08:13:20","2023-07-10 08:13:20","2023-07-10 08:13:21","274-281","","3","18","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/ADVCIP2B/Richards - 2013 - Beyond DIY in Electronic Music.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Important historical developments in music over the last century are reconsidered to be, at least in part, strategies for circumventing technological limitations to manipulating and accessing all sound. Support for this perspective is found in the words of artists and composers of the time and in comparisons between the technologies available for creation in the visual and the sonic arts.

These systems have the capacity to vary their output with each run, often from no more input information than the seeding of a random number generator with the start time. Such artworks are accumulating, released online as downloads, or exhibited through streaming radio sites such as rand()%. Listener/users and composer/designers may wish for deeper insight into these programs' ontological status, mechanisms and creative potential. These works are challenging to dissect; this article makes a tentative start at confronting the unique problems and rich behaviours of computer-program-based generative music, from the social and historical context to the backwards engineering of programs in relation to their sound world.

This text suggests that the seemingly exclusive bond between the art form of music and its primary medium, sound, might be opened up to include other media. If the practices of composers who also appear as sound- and kinetic artists are not recognised as music, possible contemporary perspectives on past music is lost and the future development of music is inhibited.The author presents an artistic perspective on transmediality, where two questions are addressed. The first is whether or not a transmedial structure can be made with light, movement and sound – and if so, how is this done? A strategy for transmedial composition with light, sound and movement is proposed, and exemplified with hand drawings. The second question raised in this article concerns whether or not transmedial compositions result in music.

His theory prompts contemplation about what ‘good’ interpretation, and interpretation itself, means for fixed electroacoustic music. A digital sound file is frequently, if not typically, viewed as more rigid and precise than a score. This article uses Adorno's theory to compare ontologies of score and digital file realizations respectively, thus questioning the above assumption. Do electroacoustic works truly exist apart from their performed features, or is a given work only its performances? Different answers imply different work concepts and interpretive strategies. Toward the essay's goals, we examine three features often viewed as nonontological to an electroacoustic work, namely performed spatialisation, equalisation, and amplitude balance. We consider the impacts of these features when they are manipulated in real time, or performance to performance. As Adorno asks how choices of timing or dynamics dictate a notated work's aesthetic ‘clarity’, this paper asks how performed choices contribute to an electroacoustic work's clarity, and to the unique interpretive potential of electroacoustic music. Tape music and acousmatic music, with its diffusion tradition, are central to this paper's thesis; but multi-channel works are circumscribed by it as well.","2013-04","2023-07-10 08:14:28","2023-07-10 08:14:28","2023-07-10 08:14:28","60-70","","1","18","","","On Performing Electroacoustic Musics","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/PB2HIDFJ/Hoffman - 2013 - On Performing Electroacoustic Musics a non-idioma.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article approaches space from the low level of musical structure, with a multi-dimensional attitude to space-form, exploring spatial texture, a concept introduced by Smalley to describe the temporal formations of space in spectromorphology (1997). Spatial articulation is investigated in the context of granular-oriented textures, proposing a micro-spatial, perceptual morphology – the texton – as an aesthetic approach to acousmatic music. This follows Albert Bregman's speculation regarding equivalents to visual perception in texture, where the theory of textons was first developed by the neuroscientist Béla Julesz.The article discusses acousmatic textons, in terms of intrinsic properties, the way they propagate in time, and how they organise in distributions to form spatial textures. The emergent macroscopic qualities of textonal formations are also reflected upon in the introduction of a group of textural states, where source-bonded spaces and abstract musical thinking coalesce.","2011-04","2023-07-10 08:14:28","2023-07-10 08:14:28","2023-07-10 08:14:28","14-26","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/PVTVJN6X/Nyström - 2011 - Textons and the Propagation of Space in Acousmatic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is proposed that the specific aesthetics, characteristics and function of a work may be more salient features than those of the medium of composition (e.g. computer) to many listeners. It is suggested that the common practice of focusing on chronology, geography and specific schools is becoming less relevant due to a proliferation of home studios, the internet, and an increasing saturation of electronic sounds in new media contexts. On the other hand, aspects of form, mood, timbral palette, rhythmic complexity, etc., may become very useful bases for choosing works for a compilation CD or concert programme. The inadequacies of musicians' discourse for describing such attributes leads to the incorporation of analogies from visual and performing arts as well as a discussion of other possible approaches to ‘labelling’ and the inherent dangers in such a task. In conclusion, it is proposed that the time is ripe for shuffling the categories and regrouping composers' works according to aesthetic preferences, regardless of the percentage of electronic/computer content.","2004-12","2023-07-10 08:14:28","2023-07-10 08:14:28","2023-07-10 08:14:28","305-313","","3","9","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/LGR5LBEZ/Mountain - 2004 - Marketing strategies for electroacoustics and comp.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The library was developed in response to the skyrocketing interest in networked music due to social distancing and travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In this article, we discuss the library’s working environment and briefly describe several similar earlier projects by other researchers. The main goals we set for the library were to collect materials, organise accessible and straightforward ways of navigating the collection, including knowledge from a wider context of time-based arts (theatre, dance and other time-based art forms), and create a community of users and contributors. We describe the main methods we use to find the works for the library and examine the current state of our collection, which has grown in the last year. Through an analysis of the entries’ metadata, we provide several examples of professionals’ use of the library. Current library users include performing musicians, teachers and composers. As the project is ongoing, we outline the scope of our future work as well as analyse several possible post-COVID applications for networked music, which include assisting socially isolated musicians, teaching, travel and new pandemics. We also show how this library could contribute to the development of new electroacoustic approaches.","2021-12","2023-07-10 08:14:28","2023-07-10 08:14:28","2023-07-10 08:14:28","340-353","","3","26","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/KKB3Y35V/Pilchen and Wilson - 2021 - Introducing the Networked Music Performance Librar.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas music performed by humans is necessarily constrained by certain temporal limits that define human information processing and embodiment, machines are capable of producing sound with scales and structures of time that reach potentially very far outside of these human limitations. But even musics produced with superhuman means are still subject to human constraints in music perception and cognition. Focusing on five principles of auditory perception – segmentation, grouping, pulse, metre and repetition – we hypothesise that musics that exceed or subvert the thresholds that define ‘human time’ are likely to be recognised by listeners as expressing timelessness. To support this hypothesis, we report an experiment in which a listening panel reviewed excerpts of electroacoustic music selected for their temporally subversive or excessive properties, and rated them (1) for the pace of time they express (normative, speeding up, or slowing down), and (2) for whether or not the music expresses ‘timelessness’. We find that while the specific musical parameters associated with temporal phenomenology vary from one musical context to the next, a general trend obtains across musical contexts through the excess or subversion of a particular perceptual constraint by a given musical parameter on the one hand, and the subjective experiences of time and timelessness on the other.","2020-08","2023-07-10 08:14:28","2023-07-10 08:14:28","2023-07-10 08:14:28","232-247","","2","25","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/AI4CV3IA/Noble et al. - 2020 - Experiences of Time and Timelessness in Electroaco.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While sound, whether constituted in phenomenological or idealist terms, is evolving and dynamic, notation is characterised by its ossifying imperative (Kim-Cohen 2009; Voegelin 2010). For Voegelin, a music score is regarded as conceptual, not perceptual. It is read as text and, it seems, has no meaningful place within a phenomenological practice of sound art (Voegelin 2010). The criticism that Vogelin’s phenomenalism, in particular, levels at notation invites close examination of notational practice and the semiotic structures that underwrite it. In this article, I seek to challenge the conceptual imperative of fixed notation through the presentation of a case study in the form of an original composition for string quartet and tape. Drawing on research by Rudolf Arnheim and Mark Johnson, a form of notation will be proposed that enables the score to escape singularly semiotic structures so that it may address the dynamic, phenomenological mode of experience that recent theories of sound art imply is beyond the reach of musical notation.","2015-08","2023-07-10 08:14:28","2023-07-10 08:14:28","2023-07-10 08:14:28","160-170","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/M2D8WJQM/Casey - 2015 - Developing a Phenomenological Approach to Music No.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We were able to determine to some extent how much each of these matrices weigh on the poetic and poiesis of the Brazilian electroacoustic production. We were also able to shed some light on how (and if) Brazilian composers relate to these matrices aesthetically and if their relation to them is merely technical, as well as trying to understand how clear cut the borders are between these two aspects of musical creation. The concepts of oppositional culture (Ogbu 1978) and established and outsiders (Elias and Scotson 2000) also helped us understand the dynamics between academia and a certain anti-academic stance seen in some composers of the genre. Using these same concepts, we elaborate, in a final note, on some brief comments about a newer generation of composers who, due to various aspects, were filtered out during the early methodological stages.","2016-08","2023-07-10 08:16:18","2023-07-10 08:16:18","2023-07-10 08:16:18","97-105","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/LLMBMEYH/Velloso et al. - 2016 - Theoretical Frameworks in Brazilian Electroacousti.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The activities of imagining, designing and building new musical instruments, performing, composing, and improvising with them, and analysing the whole process in an effort to better understand the interface, our physical and cognitive associations with it, and the relationship between performer, instrument and audience can only be seen as an ongoing iterative work-in-progress. It is long-term evolutionary research, as each generation of a new musical instrument requires inventiveness and years of dedication towards the practice and mastery of its performance system (comprising the interface, synthesis and the mappings between them). Many revisions of the system may be required in order to develop musical interface technologies that enable us to achieve truly expressive performances. The MITDS provides a conceptual framework for describing, analysing, designing and extending the interfaces, mappings, synthesis algorithms and performance techniques for interactive musical instruments. It provides designers with a theoretical base to draw upon when creating technologically advanced performance systems, and can be seen as a set of guidelines for analysis, and a taxonomy of design patterns for interactivity in musical instruments. The MITDS focuses mainly on human-centred design approaches to realtime control of the multidimensional parameter spaces in musical composition and performance, where the primary objective is to close the gap between human gestures and complex synthesis methods.","2009-08","2023-07-10 08:16:18","2023-07-10 08:16:18","2023-07-10 08:16:18","217-226","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/85DGGSGN/Overholt - 2009 - The Musical Interface Technology Design Space.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike tape music, interactive music can continuously vary its response and, frequently, performers are unable are to predict how the computer will react. Many, if not most, scores include no visual representation of how the computer may affect the sound of the instrument.Providing performers with a readily accessible visual representation of the sonic possibilities of interactive computer music will provide a conceptual framework within which performers can understand a piece of music. Interpretation of this type of notation by the performer will provide a perspective on how his or her acoustic instrument relates to the digital instrument. This can be especially useful when improvised or aleatoric methods are called for.This paper outlines a system of interactive computer-music descriptive notation that links pictographic representations to the system of spectromorphologies suggested by Dennis Smalley. The morphological notation (MN) uses these morphologies and adds a z-plane to the well-established time-vs-pitch schema. Ideally, MN will not only represent the sound data of the moment, but also will be an intuitive picture of the musical possibilities of a composition's electronic component.","2007-08","2023-07-10 08:16:18","2023-07-10 08:16:18","2023-07-10 08:16:18","123-128","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/J4K3VVCL/Patton - 2007 - Morphological notation for interactive electroacou.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two concepts are introduced to propose this alternative approach to electroacoustic music description: temporal directionality, which focuses on the sounds themselves, and temporal distancing, which focuses on the relations between sounds. Throughout this article, several musical examples are given to briefly exemplify how such concepts can be used in an explanatory context. Finally, polychrony is introduced, which aims to describe how electroacoustic composers play with the various cases of temporal directionality and distancing, and, in the process, actually weave time itself.","2020-08","2023-07-10 08:16:18","2023-07-10 08:16:18","2023-07-10 08:16:18","248-258","","2","25","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/VQ2D6WID/Dahan - 2020 - A Temporal Framework for Electroacoustic Music Exp.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Notions such as agility, agency and authorship in music composition and improvisation are in parallel with game design and play, where players are asked to develop skills through affordances within a digital game-space. It is argued that the recent democratisation of game engines opens a wide range of expressive opportunities for real-time game-based improvisation and performance.

Consequently, it also represents a useful language within which to develop generative systems of art. A pattern theory inspired framework and set of algorithms for interactive computer music composition are presented in the form of a self-organising hidden Markov model – a modular, graphical approach to the representation and spontaneous organisation of sound events in time and in parameter space. The result constitutes a system for composing stochastic music which incorporates creative and structural ideas such as uncertainty, variability, hierarchy and complexity, and which bears a strong relationship to realistic models of statistical physics or perceptual systems. The pattern theory approach to composition provides an elegant set of organisational principles for the production of sound by computer. Further, its machine learning underpinnings suggest many interesting applications to emergent tasks concerning the learning and creative modification of musical forms.","2004-08","2023-07-10 08:16:18","2023-07-10 08:16:18","2023-07-10 08:16:18","151-165","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/F67UH9V2/Visell - 2004 - Spontaneous organisation, pattern models, and musi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After an introduction about the benefits of interdisciplinary research and research-creation practice there is a description of the different domains of the framework: acoustic analysis, music analysis itself and the design of graphic representations. The framework is based on the extraction of information from the audio signal (music information retrieval) to create data representations, some of which are very efficient for music analysis, such as the brightness standard deviation or the self-similarity matrix.

The idea, inherited from the tradition of ‘absolute music’, that musical meaning lies exclusively in the inner operations of the musical materials and their structural organisation, is questioned. Concepts from ecologically inspired music psychology are drawn upon to highlight the importance of interpretation, as well as perception, in acousmatic listening. It is argued that if new theoretical terminologies are needed, an invaluable project would be to develop a taxonomy (and thus theoretical framework) of how sound can ‘stand for something’, i.e. function as a sign in semiotic terms. It is also argued that such terminology should not reinforce distinctions between intra- and extra-musical that feature in many theoretical constructs used in relation to this music. Consideration of the Peircean semiotic model in electroacoustic music (as well as the more widely used Saussurean one), tropology in the study of literature, and a much more widely comparative and culturally explicit approach to analysis are suggested as practical starting points. A more critical approach to the integral role of sound recording and reproduction in relation to concepts of representation is needed.","2007-08","2023-07-10 08:16:18","2023-07-10 08:16:18","2023-07-10 08:16:18","113-122","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/8Q4XVNG7/Atkinson - 2007 - Interpretation and musical signification in acousm.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, it studies the academic literature of the last five years with regard to the gender of the participants and the gender awareness of its content. Men are found to outnumber women in the field. The inspection of the literature shows a marked absence of documented gender awareness in the field. Then, the paper explores gender in new music interface technology performances of the last five years: two by male and two by female performers. It is discussed how they individually and in their cross-relationship speak to gender constructions. The analysis suggests that female performances seem to speak to gender issues whereas male performances seem to show an absence of gender as category. Finally, a further device is contrasted with these performances. I suggest that this technology is of particular interest for the artistic exploration of gender by making the body the recipient of performance.","2003-04","2023-07-10 08:16:18","2023-07-10 08:16:18","2023-07-10 08:16:18","19-30","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/XWIYQTYS/Essl - 2003 - On gender in new music interface technology.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building on prior work (Whalley 2009, 2012c), GNMISS (Graphic Networked Music Interactive Scoring System) was developed to address this. The system has four visual layers that illustrate the structure of works, represented on a circle with parts for each player. One layer maps emotions to colours based on associated words as a primary basis for gesture and timbre representation. A second layer gives musical motives and frequency information for participants to follow. A third allows for more detailed indications of gesture and sound archetypes through representative symbols. Finally, an inside layer represents macro key centres. For timing, the circle score turns in clock time with the current playing position always at noon, and a central metronome shows speed independent of clock time. Technically, client programs sit on distributed machines across the Internet, with data being coordinated by an OSC Server. Distributed scores can be built by a composer or by a team, and all content can be altered simultaneously across client machines.

The paper succinctly emphasises the pronounced epistemic dimension of digital instruments when compared to acoustic instruments. Through the analysis of material epistemologies it is possible to describe the digital instrument as an epistemic tool: a designed tool with such a high degree of symbolic pertinence that it becomes a system of knowledge and thinking in its own terms. In conclusion, the paper rounds up the phenomenological and epistemological arguments, and points at issues in the design of digital musical instruments that are germane due to their strong aesthetic implications for musical culture.","2009-08","2023-07-10 08:17:10","2023-07-10 08:17:10","2023-07-10 08:17:10","168-176","","2","14","","","Of Epistemic Tools","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/3Y5ZTK2Y/Magnusson - 2009 - Of Epistemic Tools musical instruments as cogniti.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper investigates the practical application of these distinctions in electroacoustic music, largely through reflective discussion of the author's own working methods, and evaluates ways in which the aesthetic effects of signal processing can influence the nature and construction of sound images. Within this, Denis Smalley's concept of the indicative field is used as a conceptual tool for the characterisation and analysis of the affective dimensions of sound image construction and manipulation.","2007-04","2023-07-10 08:17:10","2023-07-10 08:17:10","2023-07-10 08:17:10","25-33","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/6U5CQ43P/Young - 2007 - Reflections on sound image design in electroacoust.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The intrinsic characteristics of the electroacoustic parts and their scoring create serious limitations. Furthermore, many sources remain inaccessible or are already lost. Thus the preoccupation with documentary sources related to the acts of creation, interpretation, and technological context becomes more and more pressing. It is now essential to formulate a synthetic vision of this music, which has existed for half a century, and to pursue the search for invariants.

For performers, in contrast, performance may be described as ‘interactive’ on many levels: interacting with acoustic musical interfaces (their instruments), communicating with composers and audiences, mediating the data of a score, negotiating prosthetic devices (microphones, loudspeakers, pedals, sensors), and interacting with invisible chamber music partners (whether backing tracks or responsive computer programs). There has been little public discussion about these issues. This paper will therefore discuss various elements of interactivity in electroacoustic music from the performer's perspective, with the goal of promoting and facilitating satisfying collaborations for both composers and performers. Discussions of pieces for flute and electronics will demonstrate various issues in performing with electronics; describe ways in which works and systems have been designed to work effectively as chamber music; and offer insights into the process of collaboration between composers, technologists and performers.","2003-12","2023-07-10 08:17:10","2023-07-10 08:17:10","2023-07-10 08:17:10","297-304","","3","8","","","Performing electroacoustic music","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/PMXE6AW4/McNUTT - 2003 - Performing electroacoustic music a wider view of .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the international literature on computer music, this development has only been mentioned in passing, if at all. However, EMS and the general development has been discussed in Scandinavian texts,1 but the links between Knut Wiggen’s technical achievements and his far-reaching ambitions for the music of the future, and how this vision aligned with philosophy and research at the time, have not been the focus. Hartenstein (2011) provides insights into Wiggen’s personal intentions and philosophy, and does not go much into technical detail, Groth (2010) focuses principally on the politics and aesthetic differences and subsequent conflicts at EMS, and although an overview of the EMS technology is provided, it is not always made clear how innovative it was. In Broman (2007), the broader lines of electroacoustic musical development are in focus.Wiggen combined social and political concerns with technical insight, and his overarching conviction of how a new art was necessary as a counterweight to mute consumerism is unique in computer music. The aim of this article is to describe and explain the coherency of Wiggen’s achievements, his philosophy, his use of current technological advances and research and his development of a new method for composing the music of the future. In order to support this focus, mainly primary sources have been used,2 however, the literature mentioned above has been consulted due to its use of interview data and other personal communication not commonly available. A degree of duplication of information has been required for the narrative not to suffer.The article will show that Wiggen was a visionary pioneer who has a natural place among such computer music luminaries as Max Mathews, Jean-Claude Risset, John Chowning, Iannis Xenakis, Peter Zinovieff and others from the same generation.","2018-08","2023-07-10 08:17:10","2023-07-10 08:17:10","2023-07-10 08:17:10","195-207","","2","23","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/WNCGP5SK/Rudi - 2018 - Unpacking the Musical and Technical Innovation of .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The introduction of new technologies in industry, composition, mediation and consumption has, in a lasting manner, changed the way most of us listen to, participate in and make use of music in our daily lives. Electronic aesthetics has finally, following a development of nearly a hundred years, started to fulfil its initial promise of becoming widely accepted and popular outside of the narrow circles of musical expertise – a ‘democratic’ music unhindered by the hierarchies of the fine arts in their different configurations. But has it really fulfilled the original promise? Is it rather not so that both the music and its promise have changed over the years?One thing is certain, our pre-adaption to aesthetic experiences has undergone extreme changes over the last twenty years or so. A paradigm shift brought about by digital media and distribution, as well as the networking of things, has directed large parts of humanity towards a new existence in the cross-section of technology and humanity, an existence where cyborgian qualities increase day by day.","2015-04","2023-07-10 08:17:10","2023-07-10 08:17:10","2023-07-10 08:17:10","30-36","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/HC8ED2MR/Rudi - 2015 - Past and Current Tendencies in Technology-Based Mu.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A view that focuses on the broad aspects of creativity support is proposed as a viable theoretical and methodological alternative: ubiquitous music practice. This article summarises several findings in ubiquitous music research, pointing to new theoretical frameworks that tackle the volatile and distributed creativity factors involved in musical activities that take place outside of traditional venues, involving the audience as an active creative partner. A new definition of ubiquitous music is proposed encompassing four components related to the human and the material resources, the emergent properties of musical activities and the design strategies involved in supporting distributed decision making. We highlight the application of embedded-embodied cognition in creative practice, arguing for the adoption of an ecologically grounded framework as an alternative to the mainstream anthropocentric and disembodied acoustic-instrumental paradigms. We discuss the relevance of the new materialist concepts of ecologies and meshworks within artistic creative practice, highlighting the implications of the emergent creativity support methods for context-based composition.","2017-04","2023-07-10 08:17:10","2023-07-10 08:17:10","2023-07-10 08:17:10","61-72","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/XCFVNFAM/Keller and Lazzarini - 2017 - Ecologically Grounded Creative Practices in Ubiqui.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Rumentarium is a set of handmade resonators, acoustically excited by DC motors, interfaced to the computer by means of various microcontrollers. Following an ecological/anthropological approach, in the Rumentarium discarded materials are used as sound sources. Every instrument is ‘produced while designed’ in an improvisation-like manner, starting from available materials. In this way, hardware is ‘softened’: that is, it can be continuously modified as in software development. Analogously, the onsite setup is very light, so that components can be added or removed on the fly, even while the Rumentarium is at work. Differently from typical computer music, the Rumentarium, while entirely computationally controlled, is an acoustic sound generator. On one hand, the Rumentarium can be played like an instrument in conjunction with a MIDI controller, for use in live musical performance. On the other side, it can be driven by algorithmic strategies. In this way, the Rumentarium can be configured also as a sound installation, in a standalone mode. Some artistic works are discussed while introducing the various control modalities that have been specifically developed for the Rumentarium.","2013-12","2023-07-10 08:17:10","2023-07-10 08:17:10","2023-07-10 08:17:10","242-254","","3","18","","","Making Acoustic Computer Music","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/LZJTRQHW/Valle - 2013 - Making Acoustic Computer Music The Rumentarium pr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a recent, also informal article (Truax 1999) addressed as a ‘letter to a twenty-five-year old electroacoustic composer’, I predicted that the term ‘computer music’ would probably disappear since in an age where the computer is involved in nearly all electroacoustic music production, this term, which once distinguished a type of music from that made with analogue, electronic equipment, seemed today to be impossible to define rigorously.

Comparing the results with information gathered from seventeen articles by composers written on the topic in 1997, it is shown that composers nowadays are more used to working with different types of spatialisation systems than before. There is also a considerable increase in the use of surround 5.1 as well as four- and eight-channel systems and a decrease in the use of stereo. The compared results also show that, in general, composers nowadays seem to be less concerned with performance and interpretation issues as well as technical aspects of spatialisation. Further studies could consider a more detailed investigation of how the new spatialisation tools have shaped the aesthetical character of the music composed in recent years.","2008-04","2023-07-10 08:18:14","2023-07-10 08:18:14","2023-07-10 08:18:14","77-81","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/32Y9PKRX/Otondo - 2008 - Contemporary trends in the use of space in electro.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model is based on the semiotic square which is considered in semiotics as a powerful conceptual framework to examine the relationships between two terms (S1/S2) and their negative (non-S1/non-S2), terms which can be characters, situations, actions, concepts, etc. Two paradigmatic axes represent the relations between the actors of mixed music: the sources (instrumental and electronic) on the one hand, and the manipulations (real-time processing and sound projection) on the other. According to the semiotic square, the relations inside the environment are defined in terms of contrariety, contradiction and complementarity. This model allows us to start out with a purely technological description of the ‘mixed music’ genre and of individual pieces, with the advantage of a pre-operative analysis of the system. It describes the immanent structure of the environments and releases the potential interactions between the instrumental and the electronics of mixed music.

This resulted in mere ‘Orientalist’ Western pieces and rather bland pentatonic/romantic ‘Chinese’ music that simply harmonised the basic outline of popular Chinese melodies with Western chord progressions. The use of recent technologies has greatly accelerated the pace and depth of this hybridisation and solved many of its artistic problems. Technological advances now make it possible and practical to incorporate the subtle but essential elements of traditional Chinese music, and of course other world musics, in works that seem satisfying for Western and non-Western audiences. This paper presents a brief historical overview of the hybridisation of Western and Chinese musical traditions, examines common pitfalls of many early attempts, and reviews how these issues are addressed compositionally and technically in the author's recent electroacoustic pieces, Li Jiang Etudes No. 1, 2 & 3.","2005-04","2023-07-10 08:18:14","2023-07-10 08:18:14","2023-07-10 08:18:14","51-56","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/YZ5N2LTM/Keyes - 2005 - Recent technology and the hybridisation of Western.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Harvey's sources and personal experiences are discussed, and the relationships between the different parts the author plays in his book assessed: the spiritual seeker, the thinker about music, and the composer. A possible conflict between spiritual search and professional music composition is pointed out, given an implicit tendency in the former to surrender, and in the latter to mastery and control. One of the questions looked into is how music, especially by articulating contrasts, may convey insight into ‘unity’. Other issues discussed are the possible addiction to music as a spiritual means at the expense of the spiritual quest itself; the alleged special role of electronics and spectrality in the composition of spiritual music; the possibility of developing spiritual listening; and possible modernist overtones in the notion of making progress as a composer while mediating spiritual insights and experiences.","2000-08","2023-07-10 08:18:14","2023-07-10 08:18:14","2023-07-10 08:18:14","103-109","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/39IU9CR8/Groot - 2000 - Jonathan Harvey's Quest of Spirit through music.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the lineage of game-based compositional praxis long precedes the advent of digital computers, it flourishes now in a rich landscape of music-making apps, sound toys and playful installations that provide access to music creation through game-like interaction. Characterising these systems is the pervasive avoidance of a competitive game framework, reflecting an underlying assumption that notions of conflict and challenge are somewhat antithetical to musical creativity. As a result, the interplay between competitive gameplay and musical creativity is seldom explored. This article reports on a comparative user evaluation of two original games that frame interactive music composition as a human–computer competition. The games employ contrasting designs so that their juxtaposition can address the following research question: how are player perceptions of musical creativity shaped in competitive game environments? Significant differences were found in system usability, and also creativity and ownership of musical outcomes. The user study indicates that a high degree of musical control is widely preferred despite an apparent cost to general usability. It further reveals that players have diverse criteria for ‘games’ which can dramatically influence their perceptions of musical creativity, control and ownership. These findings offer new insights for the design of future game-based composition systems, and reflect more broadly on the complex relationship between musical creativity, games and competition.","2020-04","2023-07-10 08:18:14","2023-07-10 08:18:14","2023-07-10 08:18:14","75-88","","1","25","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/3E89G7CU/Studley et al. - 2020 - Evaluating Digital Games for Competitive Music Com.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This observation compels us to intensify our study of a taxonomy of agents and processes, with the aim of clarifying the identity of this music.The discussion is positioned according to two different vantage points: (i) analysis of works, and (ii) the writings devoted to the aesthetics of electroacoustic music. Musicological analysis is simultaneously the means, the goal and the motivation for getting to know this arborescent reality. It allows us to arrive at the identification of six agents and four processes associated with the work, whose main properties we will describe.

Drawing on musical examples from various underground electronic music genres and on interviews with electronic musicians, this essay addresses such questions as: What is a sampler, and how does the sampling process resonate with or diverge from other traditions of instrument-playing? How do electronic musicians use the ‘automated’ mechanisms of digital instruments to achieve nuanced musical expression and cultural commentary? What are some political implications of presenting sampled and processed sounds in a reconfigured compositional environment? By exploring these issues, I hope to counter the over-simplified, uninformed critical claims that sampling is a process of ‘theft’ and ‘automation’, and instead offer insight into the myriad and complex musical and political dimensions of sampling in electronic music production.","2003-12","2023-07-10 08:18:14","2023-07-10 08:18:14","2023-07-10 08:18:14","313-320","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/F26SXMVM/Rodgers - 2003 - On the process and aesthetics of sampling in elect.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Starting from the late nineteenth century in particular, many of them have looked at this specific sound material for several reasons: overcoming the limitations of tonal system, discovering different compositional strategies, finding new inspiration and aesthetics, evoking exoticism. Electronic music is no exception. Since the emergence of sound recording, sonic artists and electronic music composers have experimented with new technologies trying to integrate traditional elements in their works with different results and various purposes. In the present time, the preservation of these traditional elements could represent one of the most crucial goals. In a world characterised by a widespread globalisation, traditional music might be at risk of being neglected or even forgotten, as for local identities and cultures in general. As electronic music composers and sonic artists we should ask ourselves if it is possible to create a link between tradition and innovation, connecting these two apparently opposite realities. Can we safeguard at-risk traditions and at the same time re-present them through contemporary artistic practices and technologies? Is there a way to develop a form of expression that could reach a wide and diverse range of listeners, taking into account recent trends and studies in electronic music while preserving the main distinctive features of the traditional repertoires?

How did this collaboration develop? Why did scientific, business, and musical agendas converge towards a common goal? Was there a mutual exchange of skills and expertise? To answer these questions this article will consider a case study in early computer music. It will examine the career of the Italian cellist and composer Pietro Grossi (1917–2002), who explored computer music with the support of mainframe manufacturers, industrial R&D, and scientific institutions. During the 1970s, Grossi became an eager programmer and achieved a first-hand experience of computer music, writing several software packages. Grossi was interested in avant-garde music as an opportunity to make ‘music without musicians’. He aimed at a music composed and performed by machines, and eventually, he achieved this result with his music software. However, to accomplish it, Grossi could not be a lonely pioneer; he had to become a member, albeit an atypical one, of the Italian computing community of the time. Grossi’s story, thus, can tell us much about the collaborative efforts stimulated by the use of early computer technologies in sound research, and how these efforts developed at the intersection of science, art and industry.","2017-08","2023-07-10 08:19:36","2023-07-10 08:19:36","2023-07-10 08:19:36","286-296","","2","22","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/NLTHYE2V/Parolini - 2017 - Music without Musicians ... but with Scientists, T.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, systems of particles can be likened to a superposition of waves. Since sound can be described as a superposition of frequencies, it can also be described in terms of a system of particles manifest as waves. This metaphor between ‘particle physics’ and sound synthesis is quantitatively developed here, suggested initially from some similarities between the two domains. It is applied to a few fundamental physical principles to show how these can be sonified. The author discusses the process of using a simulated ‘atom trap’ to compose a piece that does not require a physicist to appreciate it. This metaphor blurs the distinctions between science and art, where scientific experiment becomes musical composition, and exploring a musical idea involves playing with particle system dynamics. In the future, methods like these could be used with a real system of particles – the particle accelerator will become an expressive musical instrument, and the particle physicist will become the composerscientist.","2001-08","2023-07-10 08:19:36","2023-07-10 08:19:36","2023-07-10 08:19:36","131-145","","2","6","","","Composing for an ensemble of atoms","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/Q2KXHPBM/Sturm - 2001 - Composing for an ensemble of atoms the metamorpho.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I pay particular attention to mixed music, without however limiting myself to it, also dealing with contemporary Western-style instrumental music. Several authors have discussed the question of the relationship between contemporary creation and certain stylistic factors of Asian cultures. They questioned what might constitute identifiable traits unique to Asia that could be observed in contemporary creations and they sought to determine whether systems of relationships can be established. Some, such as Chou Wen-Chung (周文中 Zhou Wenzhong), emphasised syncretism, thus establishing a link with the works of anthropology and cultural studies. In his 1971 article, ‘Asian Concepts and Twentieth-Century Western Composers’, Chou cites many examples that tend to emphasise notions of integration and syncretism across various stylistic gradients found in many composers, mostly Western. More recently, musicologist Yayoi Uno Everett described distinct categories in these relationships, on the part of both Asian and Western composers. This article attempts to find which cultural gradients can be observed in the electroacoustic music production of Chinese composers. For instance, the specific case of mixed music creates an unprecedented situation of contact between instrument and sound material in the context of renewed intercultural relations.","2022-12","2023-07-10 08:19:36","2023-07-10 08:19:36","2023-07-10 08:19:36","284-293","","3","27","","","Crossing Lines","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/QL6352VG/Battier - 2022 - Crossing Lines Stylistic gradients in Chinese ele.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on the author’s collaborative practice in sound creation, Maria Lind’s classification of types of collaboration is extended to develop the notion of a ‘quadruple’ variant. This is based on the relationship between human and non-human collaborators. The role of the ‘Trickster’ is developed as a means of supporting and facilitating amateurs operating in a radical context. I propose, and provide a manifesto for, a category of the ‘New Amateur’ who addresses social engagement in sound practices in at least two ways. First, via structural dependence on a notion of collaboration significantly expanded to include not only other humans but also materials, ideas and both non- and post-human entities. Second, by drawing upon the anarchist ethics and concepts of the Trickster to democratise artistic potential through collaborative and distributed authorship. Thus, the manifesto reflects a political dimension rooted in the everyday and reveals a route to social engagement via personal creative awakening. The New Amateur offers fresh possibilities in music and organised sound and engages via an unleashing of individual capability to mirror the ‘lines of flight’ pursued by John Cage, La Monte Young and Alan Kaprow. The mechanism initiated in this way locates individual creativity in the context of mutual aid. Social engagement is driven by individual creativity and the explosive awareness of the potential this awakens.","2023-04","2023-07-10 08:19:36","2023-07-10 08:19:36","2023-07-10 08:19:36","43-52","","1","28","","","New Amateurs and Tricksters","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/HUAZCJHE/Fox - 2023 - New Amateurs and Tricksters A manifesto for music.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article we examine the ways in which computer music languages might similarly influence the aesthetic decisions of the digital music practitioner, even when those languages are designed for generality and theoretically capable of implementing any sound-producing process. We examine the basis for querying the non-neutrality of tools with a particular focus on the concept of idiomaticity: patterns of instruments or languages which are particularly easy or natural to execute in comparison to others. We then present correspondence with the developers of several major music programming languages and a survey of digital musical instrument creators examining the relationship between idiomatic patterns of the language and the characteristics of the resulting instruments and pieces. In an open-ended creative domain, asserting causal relationships is difficult and potentially inappropriate, but we find a complex interplay between language, instrument, piece and performance that suggests that the creator of the music programming language should be considered one party to a creative conversation that occurs each time a new instrument is designed.","2020-04","2023-07-10 08:19:36","2023-07-10 08:19:36","2023-07-10 08:19:36","53-63","","1","25","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/D4T5M4UI/McPherson and Tahıroğlu - 2020 - Idiomatic Patterns and Aesthetic Influence in Comp.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is argued that Davies, particularly via his International Electronic Music Catalog (published 1968), characterised electronic music for the first time as a truly international, interdisciplinary praxis, whereas in the preceding literature the full extent of that international, interdisciplinary scope had been represented only partially, and in a way that was heavily biased in favour of the ostensibly ‘main’ Western European and North American schools. This argument is demonstrated by referring to a range of published sources dating from 1952 to 1962, which represented the praxis of electronic music as somewhat fragmented and parochial, and to a range of Davies’s published and unpublished writings, which conveyed a sense of the various international, aesthetic and disciplinary threads coalescing into an apparently coherent whole. An interpretation of Davies’s motivations for representing electronic music in this way is provided, which has to do with his belief in international and interdisciplinary exchange as catalysts for the development of the electronic idiom. Many subsequent publications rely upon the data provided in the Catalog, which continues to be, arguably, the most complete record of international, interdisciplinary electronic music activity up to the end of 1967. Some examples are given that illustrate the influence of the Catalog upon subsequent studies. It is concluded that further work is needed in order to fully understand and evaluate the historiographic consequences of the Catalog’s influence upon discourses of electronic music history.","2015-04","2023-07-10 08:19:36","2023-07-10 08:19:36","2023-07-10 08:19:36","111-121","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/R4HI2EK5/Mooney - 2015 - Hugh Davies’s Electronic Music Documentation 1961–.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On one hand, audiovisual materials appear to offer the possibility of complementing one another – of forming a highly effective means of communicating artistic ideas – and on the other, they appear to carry the risk of detracting from one another – of deforming the musical language that he or she has worked so hard to create. Durk Talsma and Max Mathews succinctly state the opposing principles. ‘Many behavioural studies have provided evidence for the hypothesis that integrating visual and auditory stimuli serves the purpose of enhancing perceptual clarity … These results suggest that communication between the visual and auditory brain areas is a highly effective and relatively automatic process’ (Talsma, Doty and Waldorff 2007: 679). ‘I personally find most combined music-video art problematic. It seems to me that the sound and images often compete for my attention … If I pay attention to what I am seeing, I often miss what I am hearing, and if I try to concentrate on the music, the images can often be an irritating distraction…’ (Mathews 2007: 94). This article seeks to transcend this paradox through the identification of audiovisual materials that function in different ways. Examples of creative work are offered to illustrate more general points of ‘language’, a model for classifying media pairs is put forward, and practical methods of audiovisual composition are proposed. The narrow findings of the study offer a vocabulary for discussing the functionality of audiovisual materials, detailed methods of media pairing, and techniques of parametric alignment, while the wider findings extend to associated domains such as live electronic music, and hyper-instrument design.","2010-04","2023-07-10 08:19:36","2023-07-10 08:19:36","2023-07-10 08:19:36","26-34","","1","15","","","Electroacoustic Music with Moving Images","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/73XVR9HL/Coulter - 2010 - Electroacoustic Music with Moving Images the art .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using this principle, devices for classes of sounds such as coarse grain collision interactions or friction interactions can be designed.

This paper focuses on this concept, and shows its crucial meaning in the composition of a number of pieces, such as Concret PH, Analogique B and the very recent Gendy3 and S709. The perspective taken is twofold: on one side, the problem of 2nd-order sonorities is seen as a problem in modelling perceptual attributes (or timbre) of sound in terms of ‘emergent properties of organised sound structure’. This is also related to the composer’s pioneering work with granular sound representations and nonstandard methods of sound synthesis. On the other, the issue is discussed in conjunction with Xenakis’ attempt at implementing thoroughly formalised ‘mechanisms’ or ‘systems’ based on the mathematics of stochastic processes. The paper shows that the issue touched on here is essential to the aesthetics of Xenakis’ electroacoustic music.

Improvisation is a space of non-semantic communication that allows for putting oneself at risk and requires mutual trust and listening, as well as dialogical qualities. This article investigates the intersubjective dimension of improvisation in electronic music praxis, focusing on how the electronic medium can be used to foster mediation between musicians. The article builds on a practice-based enquiry in duo format, conducted in three successive technological settings, with a methodological entanglement of aesthetic and design aims. Systematic video documentation and participant observation provide an analytical counterpoint to an immersion in the improvisatory praxis. A set of design strategies for fostering intersubjective connection in shared musicianship emerges from the research. The findings provide the basis for a dialectical consideration between musical and intersubjective aesthetics. The discussion points to the diversity of social functions of music and their respective aesthetics. Electronic instruments’ inherent plasticity allows for reconfiguring the social space of music-making, and thus opens perspectives for devising synergetic music systems that emphasise an ethos of shared agency over the production of musical objects or performances.","2021-04","2023-07-10 08:21:06","2023-07-10 08:21:06","2023-07-10 08:21:06","5-18","","1","26","","","Co-Sounding","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/LMKDNG7K/Lähdeoja and Oca - 2021 - Co-Sounding Fostering intersubjectivity in electr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its main goal is to allow any user – especially those with no expertise in music – to draft musical pieces collectively, in a prototyping manner. So, such musical sketches – we call them music prototypes – can be repeatedly tested, listened to, and modified, not only by their original creators but also by the online partners that will cooperate in their refinement, until their final form is reached. CODES enables sharing of knowledge by means of rich interaction and argumentation mechanisms associated to each prototype modification, which are also secure ways of providing awareness to this asynchronous collaborative environment. In this paper, we present the concept of music prototyping and introduce the main aspects related to cooperative prototyping of musical pieces, focusing on issues concerning a musical piece as a collective creation of a virtual community.

Various centres in the region are active in music technology-related work: the Music Department at Universiti Putra Malaysia, the Electronic Music Lab at the National University of Singapore, and Creative Resource at the International Business Park in Singapore. The First International Music Technology Conference in Southeast Asia held in Kuala Lumpur recently received lukewarm response in terms of turnout and contributions.

In Midlands (2019), Sam Salem presents an (auto)ethnographical account of his relationship to the city of Derby, UK. By deriving musical materials from audio generated by the deep neural network WaveNet, Salem creates an uncanny, not-quite-right representation of his childhood hometown. Similarly, in her album A Late Anthology of Early Music Vol. 1: Ancient to Renaissance (2020), Jennifer Walshe uses the neural network SampleRNN to create a simulated narrative of Western art music. By mapping her own voice onto selected canonical works, Walshe presents both an autoethnographic and anthropological reimagining of a musical past and questions practices of historiography. These works are contextualised within the practice and theory of filmmaker-ethnographer Trinh T. Minh-ha and her notion of ‘speaking nearby’. In extension of Tim Ingold’s conception of anthropology, it is shown that both works make collaborative human and non-human inquiries into the possibilities of human (and non-human) life.","2022-08","2023-07-10 08:21:06","2023-07-10 08:21:06","2023-07-10 08:21:06","219-226","","2","27","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/5GD5UGXH/Dyer - 2022 - Neural Synthesis as a Methodology for Art-Anthropo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such works have already been widely analysed and discussed. Moreover, similarities between them have been pointed out, such as the use of the voice as their main compositional material and the search for a continuum between the voice and electronic sounds. Despite their similarities, we argue that the perception of time in those works is significantly different. For that purpose, we bring theoretical references such as time concepts related to complex dynamic systems, and the perception of time according to the Gestalt theory. We discuss segmentation and texture evolution in time of both works employing graphical representations based on perceptual audio descriptors such as the mel scale and the volume. In addition, aiming to find recurrences, repetitions and variations of the spectral material in time, we apply phase space graphs addressing the values of the descriptors employed in the analysis. The features found will lead to conclusions on the emergence of time perception in which the continuity depends on the presence of similar events, periodicities and pregnancies, while discontinuity is given by the presence of more variation, instability and saliences. We emphasise the differences of form perception in those pieces, arguing that they are the result of the manipulation of sound materials and organisation in time by the composers.","2020-08","2023-07-10 08:21:06","2023-07-10 08:21:06","2023-07-10 08:21:06","156-167","","2","25","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/7XJYGUB3/Rossetti et al. - 2020 - Compositional Procedures in Electronic Music and t.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within popular music, this notion of sound sometimes supplies the very identity of a tune, a band or a musician. Sound is often conceptualised as a virtual space and in turn compared to actual spatial environments, such as a stage or an enclosed room. One possible consequence of this tendency is that this virtual space can become utterly surreal, displaying sonic features that could never occur in actual physical environments. This article concerns the ways in which the increased possibilities for creating a spatially surreal sound, thanks to new technological tools, have been explored within the field of popular music over the past few decades. We also look at the ways in which the effect of such features may have changed over time as a consequence of what we call processes of naturalisation. As a particularly interesting example of the complexity of such processes, we explore ‘the music sound stage’. In addition, we analyse three songs by Prince, Suede and Portishead to reveal the possibly surreal aspects of these productions.","2013-04","2023-07-10 08:21:06","2023-07-10 08:21:06","2023-07-10 08:21:06","71-80","","1","18","","","The Naturalised and the Surreal","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/3BES9WPQ/Brøvig-Hanssen and Danielsen - 2013 - The Naturalised and the Surreal changes in the pe.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A review of noise in music of the twentieth century and beyond shows how this has become increasingly understood by composers, and that the greater use of noise as a sound source has arisen out of developments in audio technology. This article argues that the music of Carsten Nicolai (alva noto) represents a consolidation of this process. The Autorec CD and the track Impulse are cited as examples of how noise is used as part of a new practice in electronic music.

This article is less a survey of what exists in the area of electroacoustic music scholarship than one looking into delineating the area and suggesting where the ‘holes in the market’ might be and how they might be filled. Are the fields of sonic art and its musicology intentionally avoiding coherence? And why do musicologists of the music of notes continue to avoid the musicology of the music of sounds? Finally, triangulation, i.e. the use of feedback and evaluation so rarely applied in electroacoustic music(ologogical) contexts, is promoted as a means to greater cohesion and understanding, avoiding what is called an ‘island mentality’ demonstrated by many individuals working in all areas of the sonic arts.","1999-01","2023-07-10 08:21:06","2023-07-10 08:21:06","2023-07-10 08:21:06","61-70","","1","4","","","Reviewing the musicology of electroacoustic music","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/QBTXI3H3/Landy - 1999 - Reviewing the musicology of electroacoustic music.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With reference to work in perception, music theory and aesthetics, it is argued that thinking about frequency is still dominated by the idea of music’s abstract significance. It is suggested that although electroacoustic music presents a challenge to such ideology, this challenge is not reflected in current musical research, leading to a peculiar dislocation between practice and theory. In conclusion, it is proposed that studying the ways in which frequency structure contributes to meaning might provide a better understanding of the production and perception of electroacoustic music than studying frequency structure in itself.","1997-08","2023-07-10 08:21:06","2023-07-10 08:21:06","2023-07-10 08:21:06","77-82","","2","2","","","Frequency structure in electroacoustic music","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/LYVDLC8G/Windsor - 1997 - Frequency structure in electroacoustic music ideo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A sonic epistemology considers not only that the acoustic ecologies are enunciative of social relations and power dynamics, but also that they tell about the way reality is lived, experienced, organised: they are expressive, in themselves. This means, for an epistemology of phonosophy, that every perception of a sound implies a conceptual movement, which carries a mental dimension that could become the material for another thinking practice, for a sophia. This article approaches music as thinking in itself: a thought of the sonic. This affirmation will be expanded through the contribution of process philosophy (Whitehead, Deleuze and Guattari, Manning, etc.), which allows a musical event to be considered as an ecology, produced by the encounter of a multiplicity of bodies (human, sonic, technological, etc.). The processes of capture of forces involved and the different techniques required to increase the expressive potentialities of the musical assemblage will be unfolded through the case of Résonances manifestes, a comprovised music piece based on a sound score composed of field recordings from autonomous demonstrations.","2020-12","2023-07-11 05:55:45","2023-07-11 05:55:45","2023-07-11 05:55:45","282-291","","3","25","","","Music Thinking Process","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/VWHTURSI/Gendron-Blais - 2020 - Music Thinking Process Unfolding the creation of .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These styles of music are characterised by essential sound configurations that evolve in time, thus eliciting a sensorial impact which transcends features regarding sound sources and affective responses. Listeners grasp what Scruton calls ‘pure events’ in a ‘world of sound’, being able to distinguish, separate and sort acoustic stimuli. The article establishes a key parallel among seminal works of Bregman, McAdams, Kubovy, Bayle and other authors, highlighting a fundamental agreement of perceptual studies in psychology, neurophysiology and musicology for the understanding of the early stage of sound perception. Music practices typical of this perspective develop certain sound configurations, such as figure/ground arrangements, recurrent elements and morphological distinction, that closely mirror our innate mechanisms of prediction in perception. A parallel is made between studies in the philosophy of perception and the neurophysiology which allows us to postulate the idea that these styles of music are essentially based on pure temporal proto-objects.","2020-08","2023-07-11 05:55:45","2023-07-11 05:55:45","2023-07-11 05:55:45","130-141","","2","25","","","The Early Stage of Perception of Contemporary Art Music","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/DDV485V8/Santarcangelo and Wanke - 2020 - The Early Stage of Perception of Contemporary Art .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the last few decades, newly emerging computer environments have enabled analysts to examine the sound spectrum content in greater detail. This has resulted in new graphical representation of features extracted from audio recordings. In this article, we propose the use of representations from complex dynamical systems such as phase space graphics in musical analysis to reveal emergent timbre features in granular technique-based acousmatic music. It is known that granular techniques applied to musical composition generate considerable sound flux, regardless of the adopted procedures and available technological equipment. We investigate points of convergence between different aesthetics of the so-called Granular Paradigm in electroacoustic music, and consider compositions employing different methods and techniques. We analyse three works: Concret PH (1958) by Iannis Xenakis, Riverrun (1986) by Barry Truax, and Schall (1996) by Horacio Vaggione. In our analytical methodology, we apply such concepts as volume and emergence, as well as their graphical representation to the pieces. In conclusion we compare our results and discuss how they relate to the three composers’ specific procedures creating sound flux as well as to their compositional epistemologies and ontologies.","2019-08","2023-07-11 05:55:45","2023-07-11 05:55:45","2023-07-11 05:55:45","205-216","","2","24","","","Analysis of Granular Acousmatic Music","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/5FDE2GVJ/Rossetti and Manzolli - 2019 - Analysis of Granular Acousmatic Music Representat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A curriculum was developed to make Key Stage 3 students (11–14 years old)1 familiar with electroacoustic music. The curriculum introduced music using concepts, such as music with real-world sounds and music with generated sounds. Presented in an online environment and accompanied with a teachers’ handbook, the curriculum can be used online or as classroom-based teaching resource.The online environment was developed with the help of user-centred design. Following this, the curriculum was tested in a large-scale study including four Key Stage 3 classes within three schools in Leicester, UK. Data were collected using questionnaires, a listening response test and a summary of the teaching (letter written by participants). Qualitative content analysis was used for the data analysis.Results include the change of the participants’ appreciation of electroacoustic music during the study. Successful learning and a decrease in alienation towards electroacoustic music could be measured. The study shows that the appreciation of electroacoustic music can be enhanced through the acquirement of conceptual knowledge. Especially important was the enhancing of listening skills following a listening training as well as the broadening of the participants’ vocabulary that enabled them to describe their listening experience.","2013-08","2023-07-11 05:55:45","2023-07-11 05:55:45","2023-07-11 05:55:45","124-133","","2","18","","","The Appreciation of Electroacoustic Music","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/SV6P4SYE/Wolf - 2013 - The Appreciation of Electroacoustic Music The pro.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article we review the history and present techniques of physical modelling. It appears that the many seemingly very different modelling methods try to achieve the same result: to simulate the solutions of the wave equation in a simplified manner. We concentrate on the digital waveguide modelling technique which has gained much popularity among both researchers and engineers in the music technology industry. The benefits and drawbacks of the new technology are considered, and concurrent research topics are discussed.

However, for some the word ‘spiritual’ is problematic, being too vague or broad, and the word ‘religious’ too narrow. To refine the word ‘spiritual’ therefore, in a way that might be acceptable also to those who are religious, I employ the contemporary concept of spiritual intelligence (SI) as a proposed framework for linking a discourse of spirituality with electroacoustic music. In addition to postulating SI as a way of framing the word ‘spirituality’, I identify three different ways in which EA composers draw on spiritual or religious material: some use existing sacred texts or methods; some approach sound itself to explore the nature of reality; finally, there are those who are drawn to ancient ways of understanding where spirit and material worlds are not separated; for example, in the West, the Pythagorean tradition.","2020-12","2023-07-11 05:55:45","2023-07-11 05:55:45","2023-07-11 05:55:45","302-306","","3","25","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/L7TJPEBE/Frykberg - 2020 - Using Spiritual Intelligence as a Framework to Lin.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Starting from Pierre Schaeffer’s musical thinking, it focuses on the perception of sound morphologies that generate from human–machine interaction. This interaction, usually interpreted under the perspective of the devices and technological innovation, will be interpreted through the perspective of musical perception and semantics. In the article, the author applies the criterion of ‘allure’, that permits the analysis of the sound object’s sustain and indicates the sound agent as mechanical, living or natural. ‘Allure’ is used as a theoretical framework for the analysis of human–computer interaction (HCI) in music. Inspired by a hypothetical perceptive Turing’s test, the author employs the ‘allure’ criterion as a conceptual tool for an aural analysis of human–machine interaction: aural analysis can indeed reveal the interaction of sound agents through the cognitive mechanism of motor imagery. This approach can be extended and developed in music information retrieval. The author will develop this reflection showing the actuality of Schaeffer’s perspective in HCI analysis. Finally, to highlight the interaction between human and electronic sound sources, the author will consider a case study: the first movement of Traiettoria for piano and electronics by Marco Stroppa.","2017-12","2023-07-11 05:55:45","2023-07-11 05:55:45","2023-07-11 05:55:45","315-323","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/7W7IHYTA/Maestri - 2017 - A Typo-morphological Approach to Human–Machine Int.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the march of technology progressed in the latter half of the twentieth century, alternative technologies opened up new areas within the electroacoustic discipline such as computer music, hyper-instrument performance and live electronic performance. In addition, the areas of electromagnetic actuation and musical robotics also allowed electroacoustic artists to actualise their works with real-world acoustic sound-objects instead of or along side loudspeakers. While these works owe much to the oft-cited pioneers mentioned above, there exists another equally significant alternative history of artists who utilised electric, electronic, pneumatic, hydraulic and other sources of power to create what is essentially electroacoustic music without loudspeakers.

The author will argue that interfaces need to communicate something of their task and that cognitive affordances (Gibson 1979) associated with the performance interface become paramount if the musical outcomes are to be perceived as clearly tied to real-time performance gestures – in other words, that the audience are witnessing the creation of the music in that moment as distinct to the manipulation of pre-recorded or pre-sequenced events.

In relation to historical as well as to more theoretical examples from the field of electroacoustic music, problems of perceiving spaces, places and locations are introduced. The solutions proposed here are primarily based on system theory approaches (as for instance Luhmann and Bühl) and newer network theory concepts (as for example Castells and Nowotny). The network is proposed as a kind of explanatory model in today's media-dominated world. Focusing on a model oriented to difference, ‘global’ and ‘local’ are regarded as categories guiding perception in matters of equality and difference.

Through the project, questions of broadcast technology, and the work of memory, are brought forward. To pursue such questions, the following article maps out the territory explored in the project. Reflecting on various threads, from habits of listening to the effects of music on individual lives, leads to a tracing out of the ‘phantasmic’ and the ‘social’ aspects of radio.

This is illustrated by three examples taken from current projects at KTH. One concerns the improvement in quality of sound reproduction systems over the last century. A test, where expert listeners rated the year of recordings of different ages, demonstrated that significant advances were made between 1950 and 1970, while development was rather modest before and after this period. The second example investigates the secrets of timbral beauty. Acoustic analyses of recordings of an international opera tenor and a singer with an extremely unpleasant voice shed some light on the basic requirements of good vocal timbre. The unpleasant voice is found to suffer from pressed phonation, lack of a singer's formant, irregular vibrato and insufficient pitch accuracy. The third example elucidates tuning and phrasing differences between deadpan performances of MIDI files played on synthesizers and performances by musicians on real instruments. The examples suggest that future development in the areas of music technology and audio processing may gain considerably from a close interaction with music acoustics research.","2000-12","2023-07-11 05:55:45","2023-07-11 05:55:45","2023-07-11 05:55:45","153-160","","3","4","","","Music technology and audio processing","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/ZTYK7BI9/Sundberg - 2000 - Music technology and audio processing rall. or ac.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The task model has been produced by applying recently developed task analysis techniques to the complex and creative task of music composition. The model itself describes the purely practical aspects of music composition, avoiding any attempt to include the aesthetic motivations and concerns of composers. We go on to illustrate the application of the task model to software design by describing various parts of Modalyser, a graphical user-interface program designed by the author for creating musical sounds with IRCAM's Modalys physical modelling synthesis software. The task model is not yet complete at all levels and requires further refinement, but is deemed to be sufficiently comprehensive to merit presentation here. Although developed for assisting in software design, the task model may be of wider interest to those concerned with the education of music composition and research into music composition generally.

This article explores the impact of the radio medium on creative practice and argues that radio art is not inherently a subset of sonic art, as it may first appear when nuanced from electroacoustic music practice, but can be viewed as its own art form with idiosyncratic international standpoints and transdisciplinary properties. In addition to a historical discussion, this article offers an insight into the potential for radio art practice to cross-pollinate with music practice and explore new creative territory and hybrid working modalities.","2014-08","2023-07-11 05:57:07","2023-07-11 05:57:07","2023-07-11 05:57:07","182-191","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/N4FPZXIU/Black - 2014 - International Perspectives on the Historic Interse.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper begins by contextualising developments in the field of musical networks in correlation with development of technological innovations, leading to the utilisations of gestural controllers in local musical networks. This introduction leads to the definition and categorisation of theoretical and practical approaches for the design of local gestural networks, addressing motivations, social strategies, network architectures, musical content, and control software and hardware. Based on this theoretical framework I describe the evolution of four local musical networks that utilise newly developed gestural controllers, titled ‘Squeezables’, ‘Musical Fireflies’, ‘Beatbugs’ and ‘Voice Patterns’. The paper discusses the design and development process of these projects and ends with a comparative analysis of the networks and controllers based on conceptual and practical criteria.","2005-12","2023-07-11 05:57:07","2023-07-11 05:57:07","2023-07-11 05:57:07","255-265","","3","10","","","Local Performance Networks","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/UWKP2XQJ/Weinberg - 2005 - Local Performance Networks musical interdependenc.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas all art in some sense exists in time, music could be said to be of time. This article, however, questions implicit assumptions about the fundamental nature of time to music. In contrast, an alternative approach to the discourse of composition and analysis is proposed in which space rather than time is privileged. Russolo, Stockhausen, Cage and Agostino Di Scipio are cited as historical precedents where the status of time in music is questioned but a more detailed consideration is given to Ryoji Ikeda, a contemporary sound-art practitioner who, it is argued, represents a turn towards the privileging of space in contemporary music practice. This article argues that an approach to composition that implicitly accepts the primacy of time tends to privilege sounds that are more easily described symbolically, such as notated pitched sounds or materials with clear spectromorphological design. In contrast, an approach that places greater concern with the work in space facilitates the greater use of materials that could be considered ‘noise’, in the sense of both a broadband spectrum and signal disruption.","2017-12","2023-07-11 05:57:07","2023-07-11 05:57:07","2023-07-11 05:57:07","378-384","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/53YLCHQZ/Collis - 2017 - Ryoki Ikeda and the Prioritising of Space over Tim.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the conventions under which the tradition evolved – controlled relationships between two or more human performers – were intended for situations apart from those found in electroacoustic music. Many composers of electroacoustic music have adopted the tradition for mixed media works that use live performers, and new customs have appeared that address issues in coordinating performers with electroacoustic elements. The author presents generative music as one method of avoiding the fixedness of tape music: coupled with real-time notation for live performers, generative music is described as a continuation of research into expressive performance within electroacoustic music by incorporating instrumentalists rather than synthetic output. Real-time score generation is described as a final goal of a generative system, and two recent works are presented as examples of the difficulties of real-time notation.","2014-12","2023-07-11 05:57:07","2023-07-11 05:57:07","2023-07-11 05:57:07","276-285","","3","19","","","Generative Music for Live Performance","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/JXFE8C2Z/Eigenfeldt - 2014 - Generative Music for Live Performance Experiences.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It addresses technological, historical, cultural and idiomatic intersections between the two art forms. From the personal viewpoint of a trained synaesthete of acousmatic origin, the boundaries between sonic and audiovisual compositional practices appear somewhat porous. The electroacoustic language is intrinsically visual, even within its acousmatic paradigm. Visible morphologies acquire a sonorous dimension as soon as we uproot them from their cinematographic habitat and plunge them into the cauldron of a new alchemy. Multi-disciplinary lines of enquiry are essential to elucidate the workings of complex multimediatic interactions such as those at play in visual music. Yet, a holistic view of the creative and technological pathways is equally significant so that artistic truths, and myths, can be (re)discovered amidst lines of code or loops of wire connecting our computer peripherals. Thus this article is written both with the language of an analyst and, perhaps more, with the expressions and idiosyncrasies of an academic composer. A few selected examples from the contemporary repertoire are discussed to exemplify a variety of approaches to visual music composition, including extracts from the work Patah (Garro 2010).","2012-08","2023-07-11 05:57:07","2023-07-11 05:57:07","2023-07-11 05:57:07","103-113","","2","17","","","From Sonic Art to Visual Music","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/GSRX7IDH/Garro - 2012 - From Sonic Art to Visual Music Divergences, conve.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The works range from 1962 (Xenakis) to 2001 (Normandeau), and include composition and improvisation, large-scale (>25 minutes) and small-scale (<2 minutes) pieces, and acoustic, electronic and manipulated and synthesised sound. Contrary to Huron’s 1991 finding of long and gradual crescendi compared to short and abrupt decrescendi in classical music notation, it is found that in successive rise–fall events the rise phase (crescendo) is commonly shorter than the fall, and has a greater absolute rate of change of intensity than the fall. Correspondingly, crescendi occupy a smaller portion of the piece than decrescendi. When categorised into dynamic steps (such as p, mp, mf etc.), crescendi are usually less numerous than decrescendi. The results are considered from a cognitive point of view, in that this structuring may influence and thus result from listener attention and arousal patterns; and from a creator/performer point of view, in that embodied or virtualised effort may be key to the impact of an electroacoustic piece.","2010-08","2023-07-11 05:58:23","2023-07-17 06:09:14","2023-07-11 05:58:23","147-158","","2","15","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/LXCS6EIY/Dean and Bailes - 2010 - A Rise–Fall Temporal Asymmetry of Intensity in Com.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The value broadcast by a node can drive the variables and time-delay factor of any other nodes in the network, including itself. Lehmer's Linear Congruence Formula, an iterated map normally used for production of pseudo-random numbers, is explored for its own potential as a pattern generator and is used as the iterated map in the nodes in the examples presented.

Given a time-domain waveform, the TFR makes temporal and spectral detail available to the remainder of the analysis, so that the component features may be extracted. The resulting ‘feature set’ must represent the sound as completely as the original time-domain signal, if the A–R system is to be capable of effective transformation and good synthesis sound quality. Therefore the system as a whole is reliant upon the TFR to make the sound components detectable, separable and measurable. Yet the standard TFR to-date is the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), of which the shortcomings, in terms of resolution, are well recognised. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the TFR to system function and system design. Poor feature extraction is shown to result from the use of inappropriate TFRs, whose underlying assumptions and expectations do not match those of the system. Existing models are used as case studies, with examples of performance for different sound types.

In addition to the presentation of melody, traditional Chinese music tends to create rhythmic beauty with a broad sound language of different attributes, which is realised by controlling the sound variation with its rich playing fingerings and techniques. Instead of evading noises, traditional Chinese music even applies noises intentionally to meet certain demands, as is very commonly found in plucked string instruments. Many typical noise languages used in plucked string instruments, while in the context of electroacoustic music, demonstrate their features in multiple dimensions of sound, such as the basic form, colour, dynamics and longitudinal gradation structure, which are gained by changes in parameters such as sound pitch, frequency, time and space information. Therefore, they imply both the basic timbre characteristics of the musical instrument and the technical characteristics of the electroacoustic music.","2022-12","2023-07-11 05:59:42","2023-07-11 05:59:42","2023-07-11 05:59:42","316-324","","3","27","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/NWCHQ7E8/Qiuxiao - 2022 - Presentation of Noise Elements of Chinese Plucked .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Spatial music is examined as a physically immersive medium in which the audience is implicated as an active component in the execution of its performance. A brief account of the historic context of spatial music will be presented alongside speculation for the trajectory of its future; particularly its potential as a model for audience engagement. This article will first consider how spatially immersive performances have the capacity to activate listeners and how can this help to engage new audiences with new ways of listening. It will also question the notion of inhabiting spatial music, with an investigation of the multiple ways in which spatial music relates to physical space and the terms of its inhabitation. The concept of virtual listening will be discussed in response to trends towards passive hearing, as driven by recent technological developments in acoustic software and hardware, and the resultant abstraction of the spatial and social dynamics of sound in virtual space. The physiological and psychological differences between listening and hearing will also be examined as a means of establishing fundamental differences in the ways that we interact with music, and questioning what our listening habits tell us about audience engagement in the context of experimental music performance. This article will also question the individual roles of the musician, composer, architect/designer and audience in the ongoing responsibility to improve audience engagement in new, or unfamiliar musical works. Importantly, this article will also explicitly examine who we are referring to when we use the term ‘new audiences’. Major developments in acoustic technology during the last few decades have somewhat confused the diagram between music, space and listener. The understanding of which elements are active and which are passive is especially ambiguous at a time when ambisonic and binaural technologies have become developed enough to provide accurate simulations of the abstract, acoustic qualities of spaces, but on virtual terms. Architects, composers, musicians, engineers and audiences are at a crossroads in the development of new music and experimental, spatiosonic practice. ‘Spatiosonic’ is a hybrid term which is used throughout this article to describe work and phenomena which regard space (spatio) and sound (sonic) as equal, interactive partners. This article considers some of the opportunities and limitations at stake in current techniques of composition, performance and listening.","2019-12","2023-07-11 05:59:42","2023-07-11 05:59:42","2023-07-11 05:59:42","297-306","","3","24","","","Activating Audiences","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/874CHLBG/Matthews - 2019 - Activating Audiences How spatial music can help u.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By tracing correlations and marking divergences between post-spectralism, minimalism, electroacoustic music, glitch and IDM’s offshoots, this article reflects on sound-in-itself, the conception of space and time in music, poietics, perceptual and cultural factors, and suggests that there is a particular understanding of sonic materialism – which I term ecstatic-materialism – that is rooted in a synthesis of perception, theory and embodied actions.This perspective explores a new expressivity of sound in which the sound itself is the point of convergence for creative impulses and perceptual motives, sound being the common territory between composer and listener. By developing the idea of an ecstatic-sonic-materialism, various works across different genres can be brought together according to this mutual convergence on sound that embodies acoustic properties, intimate traces, external and corporeal experiences.","2017-12","2023-07-11 05:59:42","2023-07-11 05:59:42","2023-07-11 05:59:42","428-436","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/H7VHENJX/Wanke - 2017 - The Emergence of an Ecstatic-materialist Perspecti.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ideas related to sound and space have been used in different discourses and practices to refer to or to explore perceptually different facets of the spatiality of sound. In the field of fine art they have been associated with the emergence of sound art, while in music, they have been associated with spatial music. In spite of this widespread interest in sound and space, the uses of spatial concepts in relation to sound and music have been inconsistent, with different authors and practitioners referring to different aspects of the complex relationship between the two. In this article I suggest a typology with five categories to describe five meanings of space I identified in the recent literature of music and sound art: metaphor, acoustic space, sound spatialisation, reference and location. With this typology I expect to clarify the contemporary uses of space and spatial concepts in music and sound art.","2015-08","2023-07-11 05:59:42","2023-07-11 05:59:42","2023-07-11 05:59:42","241-248","","2","20","","","Investigating Sound in Space","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/7BACTU2T/Macedo - 2015 - Investigating Sound in Space Five meanings of spa.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Anthropomorphic musical robots and bodily integrated ‘cyborg’ sensor interfaces explore complementary manifestations of what we call the ‘anthropomorphic analogy’, which probes the boundary between human artificer and artificial machine, encouraging listeners and viewers to humanise non-musical machines and understand the human body itself as a mechanical instrument.These new approaches to the anthropomorphic analogy benefit from historical contextualisation. At numerous points in the history of Western art music, philosophers, critics, composers, performers and instrument designers have considered the relationship between human musician and musical instrument, often blurring the line between the two. Consideration of historical examples enriches understandings of anthropomorphism in contemporary music technology.This article juxtaposes the anthropomorphic analogy in contemporary musical culture with manifestations of anthropomorphism in early seventeenth-century Europe. The first half of the seventeenth century witnessed a flourishing of instrumentality of all sorts. Musical instruments were linked with the telescope, the clock, the barometer, the paintbrush, and many other instruments and machines, and these came to be understood as vehicles for the creation of knowledge. This flourishing of instrumental culture created new opportunities for contemplation and aesthetic wonder, as theorists considered the line between human being and machine – between nature and artifice. Manifestations of the anthropomorphic analogy in seventeenth-century conceptions of musical instruments help to contextualise and explain similar articulations of the anthropomorphic analogy in the present day.","2018-08","2023-07-11 05:59:42","2023-07-11 05:59:42","2023-07-11 05:59:42","167-180","","2","23","","","The Anthropomorphic Analogy","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/BFDKMS3V/Cypess and Kemper - 2018 - The Anthropomorphic Analogy Humanising musical ma.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The conceptualisation of sounds as having mass or as matter, particularly on an imagined ‘atomic’ level as is implicit in microsound, has had many historical antecedents, especially in the twentieth century. However, the comparison, representation and analogy of sound as an object of material composition is a peculiar metaphor as sound has no inherent material substance. At the meeting point of microsound, a wide spectrum of musicians and listeners across genres and subgenres has converged, along with a diverse range of technologies and approaches to those technologies. In what follows, an exploration of the inception and implications of microsound will offer one instructive path that helps elucidate the intertwined relationship between sound art and experimental electronica. Thus, this paper adds to the critical dialogue regarding these complex yet drastically under-theorised fields of creative activity by using microsound to articulate specific points of connection, commonality and divergence.","2014-12","2023-07-11 05:59:42","2023-07-11 05:59:42","2023-07-11 05:59:42","295-303","","3","19","","","‘Atomic’ Music","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/SY6D8PVI/Hofer - 2014 - ‘Atomic’ Music Navigating experimental electronic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Flutist, improviser and composer Anne La Berge signalled this and other problems related to gender in ‘Kraakgeluiden’, a Dutch venue for improvisation in electroacoustic music. Four possible factors contributing to gender discrimination are proposed: the stereotypical gendered concept of an improviser, differences in communicative styles, the dominance of male networks, and music technology itself. This is followed by a consideration of gendered differences in music improvisation. It is posited that male improvisers often seek to establish a hierarchy among themselves, while women performers tend to project themselves less to the forefront. Women improvisers may traditionally have a different sense of autonomy, in adherence to gender norms. While music education might offer a means to change behaviour patterns, it appears that these gender norms are internalised at a surprisingly young age. While concentrating on electroacoustic improvisation, this essay also includes relevant experiences of other improvisers. Gender discrimination in electroacoustic music improvisation is a complex issue deserving more research.","2004-08","2023-07-11 05:59:42","2023-07-11 05:59:42","2023-07-11 05:59:42","199-206","","2","9","","","Women and ‘Kraakgeluiden’","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/ZGRNTKFI/Metzelaar - 2004 - Women and ‘Kraakgeluiden’ the participation of wo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We then situate our work within a genealogy of human–machine improvisation, while highlighting specific values that continue to motivate our artistic approach. These practical accounts inform our discussion of tactility, proximity, effort, friction and other attributes that have shaped our strategies for designing musical interactions.

Composers would certainly welcome the possibility of being able to predict more objectively the effect of particular musical configurations on their audiences. Furthermore, new music technologies are bound to emerge from such understanding. Despite an impressive amount of ongoing research into the neuroscience of music, progress in this field still remains largely uncharted for musicians and unexplored by developers of technology: the literature is complex and difficult to disentangle. This paper is an attempt to chart the field for the readership of this journal. It articulates a working hypothesis for the neural basis of mental imageries elicited by music, based on the notion that such imageries are by-products of the inherent abstracting and predicting properties of the brain. It is argued that such mental imageries are scaffolds for music perception. The paper also speculates on the impact that a better understanding of the musical brain may have on the development of future technology for electroacoustic music, which may include the development of new analysis tools such as the olivogram and the thalamogram.","2010-04","2023-07-11 05:59:42","2023-07-11 05:59:42","2023-07-11 05:59:42","13-25","","1","15","","","Organised Sound, Mental Imageries and the Future of Music Technology","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/9IJDI9VD/Miranda - 2010 - Organised Sound, Mental Imageries and the Future o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Phase one of the project focuses on E/A compositions that contain or are perceived to contain real-world sound references (RWE/A). The methodology involves introducing works that are unknown to the listening subjects and then evaluating their listening experience. Through repeated listening and the introduction of the composers' articulation of intent (through a work's title, inspiration, elements that the composer intends to be communicated, eventually elements of the compositional process itself – in short, the ‘dramaturgy’ of the work) listening responses are monitored. The purpose here is to investigate to what extent familiarity contributes to access and appreciation and to what extent intention and reception are meeting in this particular corpus of E/A art music.This paper offers an introduction to the I/R project outlining its background, its context and presenting pertinent points concerning the design and operation of its methodology.

The first part of the article begins with a discussion of the musical material under research. Thereafter follows an elaborate overview of the number of male and female composers, vocalists and recorded voices in several series of CDs of electroacoustic and computer music. The gendered roles of the live, pre-recorded and synthesised voices are discussed and the musical couple of the male composer and the female vocalist emerges. The second part touches upon several issues raised by the results of part one: the roles of the performer and the composer, (dis)embodiment, femininity and technology.

The PSOs project approaches the idea of collaborative musical performances over the Internet by aiming to go beyond the concept of using computer networks as a channel to connect performing spaces. This is achieved by exploring the internet's shared nature in order to provide a public musical space where anonymous users can meet and be found performing in collective sonic art pieces.The system itself is an interface-decoupled musical instrument, in which a remote user interface and a sound processing engine reside with different hosts in an extreme scenario where a user can access the synthesizer from any place in the world using the World Wide Web. Specific software features were implemented in order to reduce the disruptive effects of network latency, such as dynamic adaptation of the musical tempo to communication latency measured in real time and consistent sound panning with the object's behaviour at the graphical user interface.","2005-12","2023-07-11 06:00:49","2023-07-11 06:00:49","2023-07-11 06:00:49","233-242","","3","10","","","Public Sound Objects","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/Q9E9IQLV/Barbosa - 2005 - Public Sound Objects a shared environment for net.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through consideration of both traditional instruments and new technology-driven interfaces, we explore the role that metaphor plays in developing expressive devices. Metaphor depends on a literature, which forms the basis for making transparent device mappings. We examine four examples of systems that use metaphor: Iamascope, Sound Sculpting, MetaMuse and Glove-TalkII; and discuss implications on transparency and expressivity.

The choreography takes advantage of acoustic events as generated by three dancers and further elaborated on via computer by the composer through use of granular algorithms and digital filtering, allowing the construction of the musical events to occur in real time. The live electronics performer changes sound parameters in relation to the dancers' movements by use of the program SDP – Sonorous Drawing Plane (S. Lanzalone) – created specifically for the control of different synthesis algorithms allowing them to be processed on systems such as Fly30 (CRM) and Mars (IRIS). SDP reads and converts computer mouse data as the operator creates lines corresponding to performance gestures, thus creating both visible and audible output.

The analysis process extracts these features from the time domain signal by means of a time–frequency representation (TFR). The TFR provides an intermediate representation of sound that must make the features accessible and measurable to the rest of the analysis. Until very recently, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) has been the obvious choice for time–frequency representation, despite its limitations in terms of resolution. Recent and ongoing developments are providing several alternative schemes that allow for a more considered choice of TFR. This paper reviews these contemporary approaches in comparison with the more classical ones and with reference to their applicability, merits and shortcomings for application to sound analysis. (Where they have been successfully applied, details are provided.) The techniques reviewed include linear, bilinear and higher-order spectra, nonparametric and parametric methods and some sound-model-specific TFRs.","1997-11","2023-07-11 06:00:49","2023-07-11 06:00:49","2023-07-11 06:00:49","193-205","","3","2","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/EJSMBFVT/Masri et al. - 1997 - A review of time–frequency representations, with a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Against this backdrop, it may not be surprising that art and music curators display historical examples of such mechanical instruments together with contemporary sounding art. Yet what exactly do these curators aim to accomplish when combining historical music automata with kinetic sound art? And do visitors understand the connections between the objects on display in the ways intended by the curators? To examine the curators’ ambitions, this article analyses three exhibitions: Für Augen und Ohren (West Berlin 1980), Ballet Mécanique (Maastricht 2002) and Art or Sound (Venice 2014). To unravel visitors’ responses, we focus on the Berlin exhibition, the best documented case. We argue that the curators staged the automated kinetic as a key historical link between mechanical musical instruments and contemporary sound art, and that they tried to tap into specific dimensions of public fascination with musical automata – the magical invisible, mechanical wonder and blurring of boundaries – to open their audiences’ senses to sound art. As we will show with the help of the notion of ‘listening habitus’, visitors’ responses indeed drew on these dimensions, but more often than not displayed a preference for the historical automata rather than contemporary kinetic art.","2018-12","2023-07-11 06:00:49","2023-07-11 06:00:49","2023-07-11 06:00:50","235-245","","3","23","","","Staging the Kinetic","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/GCHUF5WX/Semmerling et al. - 2018 - Staging the Kinetic How music automata sensitise .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we suggest that a conceptualisation of possible modes of performance–time interaction can only be sensibly approached in light of the ways that computers alter the social–artistic interactions that are precursive to performance. This conceptualisation hinges upon a consideration of the changing roles of composition, performer and instrument in contemporary practice. We introduce the term behavioural object to refer to software that has the capacity to act as the musical and social focus of interaction in digital systems. Whilst formative, this term points to a new framework for understanding the role of software in musical culture. We discuss the potential for behavioural objects to contribute actively to musical culture through two types of agency: performative agency and memetic agency.","2009-08","2023-07-11 06:00:49","2023-07-11 06:00:49","2023-07-11 06:00:50","188-196","","2","14","","","Understanding Interaction in Contemporary Digital Music","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/WLPN9D4A/Bown et al. - 2009 - Understanding Interaction in Contemporary Digital .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper reviews recent neuroscientific research that may assist differentiation between effective pedagogical approaches of these two subjects where knowledge is stored in separate, discrete and sometimes competing long-term memory locations (Cotterill 2001). It argues that, because of these differences, the learning of music technology and electroacoustic composition is best kept separate, at least in the beginning stages. These points are underscored by an example of a demonstrably failed pedagogical model for teaching electroacoustic composition contrasted with a subsequent highly successful model employed in the same university music programme; an experience that may translate well to other learning environments.","2013-08","2023-07-11 06:01:59","2023-07-11 06:01:59","2023-07-11 06:01:59","190-200","","2","18","","","Failure, Neuroscience and Success","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/EL53Q7WR/Keyes - 2013 - Failure, Neuroscience and Success Differentiating.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It starts with a discussion of the role of sound in social robotics and surveys various notable conceptual approaches to robot sound. The central thesis of the article is that electroacoustic music can provide a valuable source of aesthetic considerations and creative practice for the creation of richer and more refined sonic HRIs by giving practitioners new ways to create believable sounding objects, to convey fiction, agency and animacy, and to communicate causality in auditory feedback. To demonstrate this, the authors describe the rationale for treating robot sound design as a compositional process and discuss the implications of the endeavour’s non-linear and site-specific nature. These considerations are illustrated using sound examples and design decisions made throughout the creation process of the robotic artwork. The authors conclude with observations on how the compositional process is affected by this particular application context.","2022-08","2023-07-11 06:01:59","2023-07-11 06:01:59","2023-07-11 06:01:59","206-218","","2","27","","","Crafting the Language of Robotic Agents","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/F2YAUMFY/Robinson et al. - 2022 - Crafting the Language of Robotic Agents A vision .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After taking into consideration the limits of the current teaching methods, the article examines various theories and approaches that involve questioning the objectivity of the learning process, the concept of multiple intelligences, the concentration on the experience as the focal point of learning and so forth. On the basis of these reflections, and after evaluating various teaching experiences over the past twenty years, the authors make some practical proposals, without imagining a curriculum, but rather by outlining several possible activities within an organic teaching project.

This model, which is inspired by literary theory, theories of radiophonic voice as well as theories of electroacoustic music, presents maximal and minimal voice as loosely defined poles constituting end points on a continuum on which experienced voices can be localised. Here, maximal voice, which parallels the informative and clearly articulated speaking voice dominant in the radio medium, is described as the converging fulfilment of seven premises. These premises are seen as partly interconnected conditions related to particular aspects or features of the experience of voice. At the other end of the continuum, minimal voice is defined as a boundary zone between voice and non-voice, a zone which is related to the negative fulfilment of the seven premises. The two poles are presented as centre and periphery, respectively, with the seven premises constituting multiple axes spreading out from the centre. These features, it is argued, parallel Lakoff's cluster model of categorisation. Lastly, the article briefly discusses the use of the framework in analysis of electroacoustic works with voice, and it demonstrates two ways in which the evaluations according to the framework can be visualised.","2013-08","2023-07-11 06:01:59","2023-07-11 06:01:59","2023-07-11 06:01:59","218-228","","2","18","","","The Maximal–Minimal Model","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/KDPLWCCI/Bergsland - 2013 - The Maximal–Minimal Model A framework for evaluat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of them belong to the general families of electric and electronic musical instruments, which we will call ‘electrophones’, in deference to the name chosen by Curt Sachs (1940). The instruments are gathered in families so that the whole collection illustrates the milestones of the twentieth century; for instance, the museum has a large set of diverse Ondes Martenot. However, due to its scarcity, the Trautonium is represented by one of Oscar Sala's Mixtur-Trautonia.Like any museum, we have to encourage the conservation of this heritage. To maintain a large collection of electrophones like the one we have, a specific knowledge base has to be developed. We have been working on this aspect of the project for the past two years. From the onset, it was decided to start the collection with the Ondes Martenot. Our aim was to define a model approach that could also be applied to other electric and electronic instruments. This work involves organising the instruments, studying them in order to outline conditions of appropriate conservation, and determining which kind(s) of restoration should be undertaken.A first step has been to gather all information necessary to understanding the instrument and its mode of performance. With this goal in mind, we have taken a complete inventory of our collection with the aim of coming up with a first assessment of the state of the instruments and determining whether to allow performers to play them. Thanks to this work, we were able to start taking precautionary measures against degradation; we are now also able to answer many questions relevant to the restoration and conservation of this collection.","2004-04","2023-07-11 06:01:59","2023-07-11 06:01:59","2023-07-11 06:01:59","87-90","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/U9C4257S/Ramel - 2004 - Conservation and restoration of electroacoustic mu.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We will discuss how lively the UPIC idea can still be today, and why we should pay attention to this approach. Indeed, there has been a relative quietness in the domain of computer music specifically regarding how we arrange graphical curves to describe the evolution of sound parameters and create a musical form. This ascertainment led to the birth of our project UPISketch, which aims at the same goal, using today’s technology. We hope that this first version can reintroduce the concept of a ‘computer-assisted tool for sound composition, assisted by drawing’ to a global audience.

Scholars have located the mid-1980s as the turning point in this development. Although consensus is lacking about the exact events and influences that initiated this field of musical production, a pervasive issue confronting historiographical scholarship has been the belatedness of this production. Linked to the trope of belatedness is an acknowledgement of the extremely rapid development of Chinese electroacoustic music, which both assimilated Western technologies and asserted distinctive national characteristics. Furthermore, one of the pioneers in the field, Zhang Xiaofu, has argued that a distinctive ‘Chinese model’ of electroacoustic music marked by stylistic hybridity and integration quickly emerged after this inception. The resulting ‘syncretism’ of practices has generated extensive reflection among Chinese composers and critics.","2022-12","2023-07-11 06:01:59","2023-07-11 06:01:59","2023-07-11 06:01:59","275-283","","3","27","","","Catching Up with the West?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/NZMM2QZX/Liu - 2022 - Catching Up with the West Historiographical stanc.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is despite Noah Creshevsky’s use of the term to describe his unique compositional process and aesthetic approach. A composer of electroacoustic music and founder of the Brooklyn College Center for Computer Music, Creshevsky has described his musical hyperrealism as a ‘language constructed from sounds that are found in our shared environment (“realism”), handled in ways that are somehow exaggerated or excessive (“hyper”)’. In this article, I summarise the ideas behind Creshevsky’s hyperreal music and compare them to philosopher Jean Baudrillard’s theorisation of the hyperreal. Numerous similarities between Creshevsky and Baudrillard’s ideas will be made evident. The first half of this article focuses on Creshevsky’s sampling of sounds as ‘simulacra’ and how the interweaving textures and melodies that Creshevsky makes out of these samples are similar to ‘simulations’. In the article’s second half, Creshevsky’s creation of disembodied ‘superperformers’ is addressed and related to Baudrillard’s transhumanism. Towards the end of the article, Creshevsky’s aesthetic more broadly and what he calls ‘hyperdrama’ are linked to Baudrillard’s ‘transaesthetics’, before a concluding note addressing Baudrillard and Creshevsky’s different dispositions towards hyperrealism.","2021-12","2023-07-11 06:01:59","2023-07-11 06:01:59","2023-07-11 06:01:59","403-412","","3","26","","","Musical Hyperrealism","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/ZS52MGYY/Windleburn - 2021 - Musical Hyperrealism Exploring Noah Creshevsky’s .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article challenges this commonly held view, arguing that the static nature of his work should be understood in terms of complex interactions between space and time rather than in dualistic terms. By analysing a large-scale sonic transformation within his 2005 album Dataplex, the article uncovers complex rhizomatic networks of materials that expand across multiple tracks. The links between the album tracks leads to an unconventional quality of musical time that contains a high degree of statis yet nevertheless presents a non-linear progression, which is created through repetition (loops), variation and re-contextualisation of sounds. The analysis suggests that experiencing the ordered series of tracks in the album means accumulating information and exploring memory within a non-interchangeable process of sonic flow and metamorphosis. Despite the fragmentary nature of these internal continuities, the resulting rhizomatic networks provide a means to understand and even to listen structurally to Ikeda’s sonic composition.","2023-06-21","2023-07-11 06:03:25","2023-07-11 06:03:25","2023-07-11 06:03:25","1-10","","","","","","Spatiotemporal Networks in Ryoji Ikeda’s Electronic Music","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/WZYLFCVC/Sudo - 2023 - Spatiotemporal Networks in Ryoji Ikeda’s Electroni.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on primary sources from across the twentieth century, it traces the case of scientific terminology becoming musical terminology, that musical terminology becoming ingrained in consumer culture, and that ingrained, well-understood musical terminology becoming, finally, metaphorical.We trace the case of spectral terminology from Joseph P. Maxfield’s articles explaining electromechanical recording to a general audience in the publication Scientific American in the 1930 s, through the application of spectral terminology in advertising during the hi-fi boom of the midcentury, and finally to the metaphorical use of the same terminology in popular music in the last two decades of the century. We show, then, that it is not only the audio engineer, but also their terminology itself that participates in a ‘double life’.","2018-08","2023-07-11 06:03:25","2023-07-11 06:03:25","2023-07-11 06:03:25","189-194","","2","23","","","Code-switching and Loanwords for the Audio Engineer","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/GTKXJ8D2/Nelson - 2018 - Code-switching and Loanwords for the Audio Enginee.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent scholarship has offered particularly useful re-evaluations of computer music software in relation to musical instrumentality. In this article, we contend that given the ubiquitous presence of computer units within contemporary musical practices, it is not simply music software that needs to be reframed as musical instruments, but rather the diverse material strata of machines identified as computers that need to be thought of as instruments within music environments. Specifically, we argue that computers, regardless of their technical specifications, are not only ‘black boxes’ or ‘meta-tools’ that serve to control music software, but are also material objects that are increasingly being used in a wide range of musical and sound art practices according to an ‘analog’ rather than ‘digital’ logic. Through a series of examples implicating both soft and hard dimensions of what constitutes computers, we provide a preliminary survey of practices calling for the need to rethink the conceptual divide between analog and digital forms of creativity and aesthetics.","2015-08","2023-07-11 06:03:25","2023-07-11 06:03:25","2023-07-11 06:03:25","191-199","","2","20","","","Getting Out of the Black Box","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/2LG2PUSY/Charrieras and Mouillot - 2015 - Getting Out of the Black Box analogising the use .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, models that approximate actual practices of electroacoustic music in the classroom are rare, with many schools focusing squarely on ICT, either as tools to facilitate traditional musical contexts or to explore innovative uses of that technology. Also, with the exception of some notable recent developments, there are few initiatives to bring middle and secondary students, or their teachers, into contact with the practices of electroacoustic music communities. The purpose of this article is to explore this problematic gap between the education and electroacoustic music communities in an attempt to identify some of the issues that lie at the foundation of an effective curriculum.

Specifically, it takes two artists, Nurse With Wound and The New Blockaders, that emerged at the same time as ‘industrial music’, and through different strategies, incorporated visual art influences into their work, to the point where influence as question is raised. Referring to Harold Bloom, the article notes that influence is not linear, nor is it fixed. The article begins with some general considerations about what noise is and how it works when in contact with music; it then looks in detail first at some works by Nurse With Wound, then at works by The New Blockaders. In so doing, it also pays attention to the material presentation of those works, which is a key part of the formal work of these artists. It concludes with some thoughts about how we can not only apply Bloom to experimental music, but that ‘noise music’ can provide itself as a theorisation of influence.","2008-04","2023-07-11 06:03:25","2023-07-11 06:03:25","2023-07-11 06:03:25","13-20","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/46V4IB74/Hegarty - 2008 - Just what is it that makes today's noise music so .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The move into more informal ‘club’ environments is not without controversy. The ‘sampling’ approach to the very act of listening and ‘consuming’ sonic art has challenged traditional concert hall presentation. This paper brings various possibilities into plans (at once conceptual but also intended to have practical application) for a multi-space ‘Sound House’: a centre for the performance of the sonic arts. This centre is socially embedded within interpersonal human interaction and is not to be found in the current performance possibilities of the Internet – though it may be connected to others of its kind through this means.","2001-08","2023-07-11 06:03:25","2023-07-11 06:03:25","2023-07-11 06:03:25","103-105","","2","6","","","New spaces / new places","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/SVB83VIK/Emmerson - 2001 - New spaces  new places a Sound House for the per.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A set of dialectical tropes are introduced to define the possibility space for organised sonified data: data-in-itself and the listener-for-itself; cognitive support and sabotage; and the Peircean triad of rheme–dicisign–argument. Taken together, these three dialectical parameters elaborate a conceptual space in which strategies can be sought for mapping acoustic parameters to data features, data structure and sonic transformations, all with respect to listener reception. A work-in-progress is discussed in connection with this general aesthetic field, and considerations of the aesthetic space are applied to several works. Finally, the notion of data verité is explored in connection to ‘big data’ and issues related to the transformation of data into information generally.","2014-04","2023-07-11 06:03:25","2023-07-11 06:03:25","2023-07-11 06:03:25","90-99","","1","19","","","Peircing Fritz and Snow","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/6RNICNUP/Filimowicz - 2014 - Peircing Fritz and Snow An aesthetic field for so.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to enable a greater understanding of temporal form in sound installations, I suggest a cross-disciplinary adaptation of musical form to the installation context. Due to the differences between concert and installation presentation practices – including, but not limited to, the increased agency of the mobile visitor – I re-examine form in installation contexts as the particular temporal experience co-produced by the first-person subject as they navigate in, through and out of the work’s frame. By applying this musical perspective to macro-scale formal structures, a set of tools and concepts become available for the analysis of temporal form in existing sound or audiovisual installations. Using practice-based observation and analysis, I describe several compositional strategies through which musical concepts of material and form can be extended in space and time: each of these strategies provides means with which to shape or constrain the visitor’s co-production of experiential form. Finally, I discuss several strategies that can be used for the creation of large-scale form, with particular reference to algorithmic design principles used in my recent audiovisual installation, Room Dynamics.","2015-08","2023-07-11 06:04:24","2023-07-11 06:04:24","2023-07-11 06:04:24","171-181","","2","20","","","Extending Musical Form Outwards in Space and Time","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/Y5WJH4JV/Basanta - 2015 - Extending Musical Form Outwards in Space and Time.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

G. Douglas Barrett’s theorisation of music ‘after sound’ is established as a crucial methodology, one that provides an important discourse around critical engagements that have largely been neglected in favour of investigations into abstracted sonic materials. The vocabulary provided by Barrett is, in this article, used to meaningfully appraise the impact of a situated musical performance and its dialogue with society. Specifically, the three authors collectively explore the implications of Barrett’s writing for the conception, formation and evaluation of their own socially engaged compositional practices. Subsequently, this discussion also illustrates the methods by which Barrett’s approach is instrumentalised as a compositional device for socially engaged composition, rather than as an analytical tool for already completed works. Finally, the authors conclude with an alternative exploration of what ultimately lies beyond a ‘music after sound’, one that problematises the notion of a specialist composer today.","2023-04","2023-07-11 06:04:24","2023-07-11 06:04:24","2023-07-11 06:04:24","88-96","","1","28","","","Post-sonic Perspectives on Socially Engaged Compositional Practices","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/7H4PPAN4/Moorehouse et al. - 2023 - Post-sonic Perspectives on Socially Engaged Compos.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simultaneously, it attempts to point out limitations in Western identity politics which complicate the identification and clarification of such themes. In particular, the Western desire to define cultural diversity through a multiplication of distinct identity constructs is contrasted with Japanese aversions to images of factionalism or political affiliation. It is postulated that the ‘Globular’ identity politics found in Japanese electronic music suggest ways of thinking around Western ideological conundrums such as the tendency to use terms of ‘equality’ (a notion of similarity) when negotiating for communal ‘diversity’ (a notion of dissimilarity). This extends to current attempts at diversification among academic and commercial digital audio producers.","2003-04","2023-07-11 06:04:24","2023-07-11 06:04:24","2023-07-11 06:04:24","97-107","","1","8","","","GLOBULE of NON-STANDARD","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/4PFHYQEK/Thaemlitz - 2003 - GLOBULE of NON-STANDARD an attempted clarificatio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this combination is an equilibrium between rationality and intuition in order to obtain a poem independent of the real world, in the sense of a poetic outcome which avoids traditional mimesis. This creative system, known as Creacionismo, has a central role between various other theoretical, artistic and mainly poetic sources informing the author’s creative process. Huidobro’s creative system has been applied by the author to acousmatic composition procedures generating the notion of acousmatic-creationist as a nomenclature for the process. This particular creative strategy balances rationality and intuition within acousmatic composition and places poetry as a driving force in the use of voice, merging artistic practice and theory in a recursive action.","2020-12","2023-07-11 06:04:24","2023-07-11 06:04:24","2023-07-11 06:04:24","333-343","","3","25","","","Acousmatic-Creationism","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/GZBURC4S/Albornoz - 2020 - Acousmatic-Creationism A creative method for acou.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Today it is possible to contrast notions of music as identical with sound (as in the discursive framework of ‘audio culture’) with artistic practices where sound and music are not at all identical, and the usually implicit hierarchy between them is probably twisted. This article discusses such matters from a methodological position that weaves together issues usually discussed in different areas of concern: it understands ecologically informed notions of sound and auditory experience as strictly intertwined with critical and inventive attitudes on technology, particularly as their intertwining is elaborated through performative practices. It suggests that, in music as well as in sound art, what we hear as sound and in sound is the dynamics of an ecology of situated and mediated actions, as a process that binds together (1) human beings (practitioners and listeners, their auditory inclinations), (2) technical agencies (the domain where means and ends are dialectically negotiated as practitioners strive to achieve a certain freedom in action across the public space of technological mediations and delegations) and (3) the environment (the physical and cultural context where sound-making and listening practices take place). The general idea is that the manners by which we shape up our relationship to sound and appropriate the technical mediations involved in working with it, are of biopolitical relevance for social endeavours that might (still) be ‘music’","2015-12","2023-07-11 06:04:24","2023-07-11 06:04:24","2023-07-11 06:04:24","278-289","","3","20","","","The Politics of Sound and the Biopolitics of Music","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/D798JN3D/Scipio - 2015 - The Politics of Sound and the Biopolitics of Music.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Observing a similar set of problems around visual suspension, I propose visual counterparts to silence and noise – by relating both to the idea of self-similarity, both temporal and spatial – which exhibit similar properties.

As well as the score, scripts or other additional documents, the works considered here also include electroacoustics recorded on magnetic tape, consequently requiring specific approaches in order to preserve such kinds of works. Video recordings of concerts are important for understanding, documenting and eventually restaging these works. This idea is not new; audio-video recordings have for many years served as sources for documenting live performances (music-theatre or art performances). However, it is still important to discuss just how and with which tools these very important documents might be preserved and exploited. Hence, the study of the structure of Molly Bloom and FE…DE…RI…CO…, both with music by Constança Capdeville, enables an understanding of the processes in which documentation is relevant to preserving such a valuable cultural heritage.","2019-04","2023-07-11 06:04:24","2023-07-11 06:04:24","2023-07-11 06:04:24","96-108","","1","24","","","Recovering Music-Theatre Works Involving Electronic Elements","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/GTPXXDQW/Magalhães and Pires - 2019 - Recovering Music-Theatre Works Involving Electroni.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If both musicians first appropriated the electronic medium for its possibilities in sound transformation, it appears that these experimentations, and more precisely those using feedback, quickly extended into areas other than research on tone and the live dimension of electronic performances. Indeed, electroacoustic feedback, as a phenomenon of retroaction, goes beyond the mere relationship to the instrument: by manifesting itself in the looping of the electroacoustic chain (microphone-amplification-speakers), it straightaway inscribes the electronic device in a spatial dimension that is linked to the propagation of sound. By analysing Neuhaus’s and Lucier’s first experiments with feedback, the specificities of their apparatuses and the experiences they aimed to create and foster, this article wishes to question the role these experiments played in the emergence of both musicians’ concern with space, which is at the core of any understanding of their later works. We can then re-read their contribution to the history of live electronic music in the light of both bifurcations and lines of flight inherent in their respective bodies of work, in order to look into the emergence of a certain art of sound installation, in which the liveness of live electronic music, far from being pushed aside, seems to lead into other forms of creation and specific aesthetic questions.","2017-08","2023-07-11 06:04:24","2023-07-11 06:04:24","2023-07-11 06:04:24","268-275","","2","22","","","Electroacoustic Feedback and the Emergence of Sound Installation","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/UN6896WS/Saladin - 2017 - Electroacoustic Feedback and the Emergence of Soun.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a new area within the discipline of music, teachers are novices to the field. This requires epistemological deconstruction of what knowledge teachers need in this new field. Then the analysis outlines how to develop teachers’ new knowledge, which can be constructed as subject content knowledge (SCK), pedagogic content knowledge (PCK) and technology pedagogic content knowledge (TPACK). This epistemological analysis informed our creation of teaching materials that develop these different knowledge domains and take account of the complex interplay between them. This process was demonstrated through the ElectroAcoustic Resource Site Projects, which first built subject content knowledge and then created teacher’s packs to build pedagogic content knowledge, and a bespoke CPD programme, which embedded their inter-relationships and built technology pedagogic content knowledge. Most importantly, creating the teacher’s packs employed a user-centred design approach, putting teachers and pupils in the centre of the development process, thereby giving them voice. Voice is an integral part of empowerment in our model, which disrupts the hegemonic grip of the academic curriculum dominated by the traditional music canon. This article adds to the knowledge-base regarding how to develop the different domains required for teaching a new subject. We argue that sound-based music is accessible to all teachers and learners, thereby increasing inclusivity. This in turn can radically disrupt ways of teaching music in schools and the model created provides the necessary scaffolding for a paradigm shift in music teaching on an international level.","2019-12","2023-07-11 06:05:04","2023-07-11 06:05:04","2023-07-11 06:05:05","274-288","","3","24","","","The Development of an Inclusive Model to Construct Teacher’s Professional Knowledge","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/JG472X49/Wolf and Younie - 2019 - The Development of an Inclusive Model to Construct.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some Dutch cases consisting of different generations of interdisciplinary, live, performance-based electroacoustic work are discussed: the work of Dick Raaijmakers, Michel Waisvisz and Huba de Graaff. These cases point to some important aspects of preservation and the formation of histories. An emphasis in electronic music histories on technology and on technological innovation comes at the expense of information on the musical and artistic aspects. For greater interest in musical aspects, it is crucial to have more access to the music itself. The works and practices of Dick Raaijmakers, Michel Waisvisz and Huba de Graaff seem to resist documentation, ontologically and practically but, on the other hand, there is a desire for its documentation and dissemination. For their work, preservation means: making something new while being faithful to the past. It is therefore that I propose to regard preservation as performance. This music only remains alive when we are not solely interested in linear innovation, but in a profound relation with the past, in reworking the past.","2017-08","2023-07-11 06:05:04","2023-07-11 06:05:04","2023-07-11 06:05:05","228-237","","2","22","","","Canonisation and Documentation of Interdisciplinary Electroacoustic Music, Exemplified by Three Cases from the Netherlands","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/GUNIZALK/Bosma - 2017 - Canonisation and Documentation of Interdisciplinar.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article focuses on the spatial aspects of Yarlung Zangbo. First, we discuss two different spatial composition preferences in electroacoustic music: image delivery and creation. We then divide the development of electroacoustic orchestral music into three different periods and examine the general spatial intention of the works in these periods. Finally, we analyse and identify four spatial composition strategies of Yarlung Zangbo: equity, virtuosity, diversity and unity. The successful utilisation of these strategies has not only made the piece a milestone in Chinese electroacoustic music, but also a unique and meaningful contribution to the electroacoustic music repertoire worldwide.

The use of the photoplethysmograph, which takes inspiration from the first medical vaginal probes used for diagnostic purposes by Masters and Johnson (1966) introduces a media-archaeological aspect to this work. Data gathered through the probe is processed and transformed into sound and visuals projected in the exhibition space. OB-scene takes inspiration from Jane Bennett’s Vibrant Matter (2010) in which she argues that human agency has echoes in non-human nature and vice versa, shifting away from anthropocentrism towards the concept of ‘vital materiality’ that runs across bodies, both humans and unhuman. Furthermore, OB-scene is affiliated with an emerging movement of women and technology called ‘XenoFeminism’ (XF). It introduces the idea of techno-alienation and focuses on the concept of other/diverse desires, new forms of desiring, experiencing something other (Laboria Cuboniks 2015). In this specific work, this takes the form of a technofeminism incorporating the fluid, the non-human and the diverse. In this performance, the body is fused with the technology, rather than empowered or enhanced by technology itself, body and technology become a unique actant (Latour 2009) enabling the audience to experience the sensorial assemblage as a space for communal experience with political implications. OB-scene is as an immersive environmental work where the senses, affect and memory were key features of ‘assemblage thinking’ (Hamilakis 2017).","2019-12","2023-07-11 06:07:33","2023-07-11 06:07:33","2023-07-11 06:07:33","270-276","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/E2PTJP4M/Troisi - 2019 - OB-scene, a Live AudioVisual Performance for Phot.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper deals with the analysis of the kinematic motion components within music, specifically music velocity (i.e. tempo) and music acceleration/deceleration (i.e. tempo change), based upon Truslit's definition of the predominant up–down motion types in music (1938). Thus, the variables of music velocity and acceleration are mathematically defined and extracted from MIDI encodings. Analysis of music velocity indicates that the differing motion types have specific and consistent velocity profiles, and that these profiles can be expressed mathematically and analysed statistically. In particular, the paper focuses on the open motion curve fit, relating the open motion velocity curve to the beta distribution. Analysis of acceleration within music suggests that music acceleration is not constant in nature, implying that theories of linear velocity are inaccurate models. Hence, it is suggested that MIDI data analysis allows for the statistical exploration into music kinematics and the motion curves within music.","2000-12","2023-07-11 06:07:33","2023-07-11 06:07:33","2023-07-11 06:07:33","137-145","","3","4","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/IW2RPAQ2/Das et al. - 2000 - The kinematic analysis of motion curves through MI.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among China-inspired electroacoustic music, the interactive multimedia work A Reflection in the Brook (小青, 2013) shows a unique expression. The author explores how the composer recreated a controversial female figure in Chinese history through a completely real-time audiovisual language: Feng Xiaoqing, thereby presenting Chinese imagery in electroacoustic music through an alternative approach. The audiovisual relationship in A Reflection in the Brook will be analysed through the lens of Michel Chion’s audiovisual theory and the perspective of musical composition techniques, further presenting the audiovisual aesthetics of multimedia electronic music.","2022-12","2023-07-11 06:07:33","2023-07-11 06:07:33","2023-07-11 06:07:33","358-368","","3","27","","","Alternative Approaches to Chinese Imagery","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/MURWQIXC/Xiaoyu and Zhenwei - 2022 - Alternative Approaches to Chinese Imagery Audiovi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From the outset, La Trobe Music saw itself as providing an alternative tertiary music education to the predominant paradigms of the time by fostering creativity through composition, technology, improvisation and other types of alternative performance practices. The philosophy of teaching electroacoustic music at La Trobe was to encourage students to find their own compositional voice rather than preach a particular style of electroacoustic music. The Department's research areas were in improvisation and technology, signal processing, gestural control devices, computer-assisted composition, analysis of electroacoustic music, realtime DSP, live electronics and installations. La Trobe's excellence in electroacoustic music was recognised by its inclusion in a survey of the world's top twenty-three computer music institutions by the Japanese journal Intercommunication 6. La Trobe staff and postgraduate students contributed papers and compositions to international and national computer music conferences and La Trobe was very much a part of the international community for over twenty-five years. The challenge now is for other Victorian institutions to meet the needs of today's students and to provide the deep research foundation in electroacoustic music that informs teaching and generates new music directions in the community.","2001-04","2023-07-11 06:07:33","2023-07-11 06:07:33","2023-07-11 06:07:33","39-45","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/67SM94U4/Hirst - 2001 - An echo from closed doors.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Waisvisz’s digital musical instrument, The Hands, helped shape the body as a recognisable agent of musical structure; this article details how the instrument controls relate to musical gesture and reveals the physical efforts of the composer through spectral analyses of the sound recording and an investigation of a 1987 performance video. The rich context of The Hands – the instrument controls, Waisvisz’s decades-long dedication to the instrument’s potential and, more centrally, the exploration of human effort in performance – have made this pioneering live-performance system for electronic music stand for more than just a musical instrument. Many authors cite Michel Waisvisz’s Hands technology but few provide musical analyses of Waisvisz’s music. The musical analysis of The Hands (Movement 1) (1986) highlights the art practice of a seminal composer–performer through one of his most important digital musical instruments and signals how the body became an instrument for playing digital electronic music.","2017-12","2023-07-11 06:07:33","2023-07-11 06:07:33","2023-07-11 06:07:33","406-417","","3","22","","","Physical Intentions","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/HS6MCJ3R/Bellona - 2017 - Physical Intentions Exploring Michel Waisvisz’s T.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the 1950s and 1960s, Cage employed electronic technologies in place of musical instruments in concert music, but also reframed the creation of tape music by following a score to be a performative act. Although Cage idealised a liberal approach to performance practice and maintained a modernist, utilitarian attitude towards technological progress, his actions and scores reflect allegiance to the ‘work concept’ (Goehr 1992). Twenty-first-century performers of Cage’s electronic music are challenged to address the seemingly paradoxical imperatives of technological progressivism and creative interpretation with fidelity to a work embodied in a score. This article discusses efforts to reconcile these forces in contemporary realisations using the interactive technologies of three of Cage’s classic electronic works. The development of interactive performance interfaces in response to musical requirements of a score is presented as an important but overlooked model for the development of new interfaces for musical expression.","2015-12","2023-07-11 06:07:33","2023-07-11 06:07:33","2023-07-11 06:07:33","290-299","","3","20","","","Interacting with Cage","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/5FXI4MDD/Gurevich - 2015 - Interacting with Cage Realising classic electroni.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The key question here is the changes made to timbral material through acousmatic spatial listening and the subjective analysis affordance of the listeners’ placement and perspective.

His argument was for composers to follow their imagination and not be bound to the constraints of musical notation. This, arguably, was one of the catalysts for the emergence of electroacoustic musical works. With past and recent technological advancement, the varieties of genres and styles within electroacoustic music have only expanded, challenging the notion of how one could analyse such works. It is therefore unsurprising that there is no general consensus on analytical methodologies. But for an art form that celebrates all musical possibilities should the analysis of such musics be constraint to a set number of formalised analytical methodologies?Rather than propose a new all-encompassing methodology, this article will argue for a universal approach to electroacoustic music analysis and the liberation of sound analysis. The concept of an analytical community (a community that accepts multiple analyses whilst encouraging practitioners to find new and innovative ways to analyse such works) will be raised as a means to address the issues facing electroacoustic music analysis, using the OREMA (Online Repository for Electroacoustic Music Analysis) project as an example of such an initiative.","2015-12","2023-07-11 06:09:22","2023-07-11 06:09:22","2023-07-11 06:09:23","316-322","","3","20","","","The OREMA Project","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/VUN2VLAA/Gatt - 2015 - The OREMA Project A call for the liberation of so.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New music is increasingly more collaborative and polystylistic, engaging a greater range of sounds from both acoustic and electronic instruments. Contemporary compositional approaches combine composition, improvisation, found sounds, production and multimedia elements, but common practice music notation has not evolved to reflect these developments. While traditional notations remain the most effective way to communicate information about tempered harmony and the subdivision of metre for acoustic instruments, graphic and animated notations may provide an opportunity for the representation and communication of electronic music. If there is a future for notating electronic music, the micro-tonality, interactivity, non-linear structures, improvisation, aleatoricism and lack of conventional rhythmic structures that are features of it will not be facilitated by common practice notation. This article proposes that graphic and animated notations do have this capacity to serve electronic music, and music that combines electronic and acoustic instruments, as they enable increased input from performers from any musical style, reflect the collaborative practices that are a signpost of current music practice. This article examines some of the ways digitally rendered graphic and animated notations can represent contemporary electronic music-making and foster collaboration between musicians and composers of different musical genres, integrating electronic and acoustic practices.","2020-08","2023-07-11 06:09:22","2023-07-11 06:09:22","2023-07-11 06:09:23","187-197","","2","25","","","The Future is Graphic","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/ZN9HNZGM/Hope - 2020 - The Future is Graphic Animated notation for conte.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It always has, and it always will. For example, technical developments in materials, mechanics and manufacturing were important factors that permitted the piano to supersede the harpsichord as the primary concert Western keyboard instrument by about 1800. And with each new technical development new performance issues have been introduced. Piano performance technique is quite different from harpsichord technique, and composers responded to these differences with new music ideas and gestures. The multiple relationships between technology and composer and performer are dynamic and of paramount importance to each party. And a true consideration of any aspect of music requires that all three areas be examined. This has always been a part of music, and so these relationships are inherently important within computer music. The difference is that electronic technology has caused a fundamental change for all aspects of music, a difference that is as pivotal in the history of Western music as was the shift from oral to written preservation of music over a thousand years ago, and then also the accessibility provided by printed music five hundred years ago. In computer music, all parties are always acutely aware of the presence and influence of machine technology in both the visual and audible realms.","2003-12","2023-07-11 06:09:22","2023-07-11 06:09:22","2023-07-11 06:09:23","305-312","","3","8","","","Live performance interaction for humans and machines in the early twenty-first century","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/AUZGST2F/Belet - 2003 - Live performance interaction for humans and machin.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In its infancy, it helped to solve perceived issues with the fixity of tape pieces, a natural continuation in the practice of live electronics. However, real-time computer music did not have the same consequences as live electronic music. This situation engendered many discussions about the liveness of real-time computer music performances at the time. It is now 20 years past those first conversations, and it is important to revisit what is ‘live’ and how it applies to real-time musics. Additionally, in some ways, the language surrounding descriptions of fixed medium works, mixed works, live electronics and real-time computer music has evolved and, perhaps, even settled into conventions distinguishing musical approach and philosophies. This article first defines the language, not to proselytise, but rather to ground the argument. The conclusion asserts that liveness is a spectrum despite the fact that ‘live’ is often used categorically. Though one may have an intuitive understanding of what constitutes a ‘live’ event, this article explicitly articulates the most significantly contributive factors. The nature of real-time computer music is explored in relation to these factors of liveness. Using musical examples, this article shows that ‘real-time’ music does not guarantee a ‘live’ performance, contrary to what is typically held to be true. Instead, ‘real-time’ simply becomes a descriptor of compositional method, and any real-time work can exist along a broad range of the liveness spectrum.","2016-08","2023-07-11 06:09:22","2023-07-11 06:09:22","2023-07-11 06:09:23","138-146","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/XSSLAVZI/Hagan - 2016 - The Intersection of ‘Live’ and ‘Real-time’.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, the idea that such devices were ‘invented’ in the studios of the first great representatives of electronic music tends to appear as an implicit consequence. However, re-examination of the long history of musical technology, from the ninth-century Banu Musa automatic flute to the Hammond organ of the 1930s, reveals that repetitive devices not only go right back to the earliest days of musical automation, but also evolved in a wide variety of contexts wholly unconnected from any form of musical institution.

This article builds upon this discussion through an examination of a number of electroacoustic composer-performers using non-Western instrumentation. This discussion will include the voices of ‘Western’ electroacoustic composers using non-Western instruments or sounds sources. It will also document some of the work of non-Western electroacoustic composers who incorporate traditional material or indigenous instruments in their music. Special attention will be given to the complexity of being in-between musical cultures through a critical engagement with theories relating to hybridity, orientalism and self-identity. In particular, this article will focus on my own practice of composing and performing electroacoustic music with the North Indian lute known as the sarode. It will discuss both cultural and artistic concerns about using the sarode outside the framework of Indian classical music and question whether Indian classical music can ever be ‘appropriately appropriated’ in an electroacoustic context.

Following an analysis of the history and failure of compositional pedagogy for developing musicianship, a new rationale for such pedagogy is presented. This pedagogy is argued to be essential for preparing contemporary musicians and audiences to understand most properly what music ‘is’ and ‘is good for’, and for promoting ever-new conceptions of ‘music’ and of its evolving values. In addition to advancing general musicianship in relation to the standard repertory, the special contribution of pedagogy rooted in composing organised sound pieces is outlined in relation to a new praxial philosophy of music that is challenging the limited and limiting theory of music and its value provided by traditional aesthetic theory. The latter is seen to be a major impediment to new compositional modes that expand musical frontiers, while the praxial theory supports, as well as gains support from, various new attempts to organise sound for expressive and other purposes.","2002-04","2023-07-11 06:11:49","2023-07-11 06:11:49","2023-07-11 06:11:49","29-40","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/5D4H3SRD/Regelski - 2002 - Sound compositions for expanding musicianship educ.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Similarly, if early French electroacoustic music counteracts the meta-serialism of early twentieth-century German electronic music, Pierre Schaeffer's Traité des objets musicaux combines his early anecdotal Noise Studies with a noise-reduction process into a new, rather German aesthetic of electroacoustics. In search of musical objects through a reductive, analytical listening (entendre), Schaeffer's neutralisation of anecdotal noises into musical objects is analogous to New German orchestration's neutralisation of individual orchestral colours in order to synthesise new orchestral combinations. Although this orchestral synthesis is different from the analytical probe for new valeurs involved in entendre, the separation of the noise from its residual signification are fundamental processes within both nineteenth-century orchestrational and twentieth-century electroacoustic musical aesthetics. If our current understanding of electronic music aligns Schaeffer and Pierre Henry wholly with modernity and its putatively radical and self-conscious break with Berlioz, Brahms and historical tradition, this article suggests that an essential underlying continuity in the French-instrumentation/German-orchestration binary persists even in the face of the decline of the musical and cultural traditions that created and sustained them.","2013-04","2023-07-11 06:11:49","2023-07-11 06:11:49","2023-07-11 06:11:49","81-91","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/LUIG29NC/DeThorne - 2013 - Schaeffer's Values, Henry's Monsters and Orchestra.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Music schools were charged with ensuring that music majors were exposed to ‘relevant technologies’. It was left largely to individual institutions to interpret what this meant. At Penn State, a course was created to address this guideline, and it generated interest among students. This course then spawned a series of related courses. These courses eventually created enough of a curricular presence to warrant creating an undergraduate minor. We now expect that the minor will spawn an undergraduate major. The music technology programme's locus lies not solely within the School of Music; rather, it overlaps as an interdisciplinary area with a variety of programmes throughout the university's offerings. These overlaps are a unique feature of the programme. It is an unusual arrangement, but it is a product of its time and place. Three populations of students have coalesced, and the pedagogical challenge has been to create a curriculum that can serve all of them. The programme might be thought of as series of concentric spheres; each is centred around the same general concept structure, but with expanding breadth for different levels of student involvement.","2013-08","2023-07-11 06:11:49","2023-07-11 06:11:49","2023-07-11 06:11:49","201-206","","2","18","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/EEYRS5A4/Ballora and Craig - 2013 - Consilient Spheres of Influence in a Land Grant Se.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recording technologies have forced us to reconsider musical space as a much more complex phenomenon, including the possible presence of imaginary spaces. Bearing in mind Henri Lefebvre’s assertion that space must be ‘produced’, and starting from Pierre Schaeffer’s notion of spatial development, this article considers the ‘materiality’ of space and the implications of such materiality for thinking about music and sound.

Atomic noise encompasses all three noise types, while adding much more subtle variations and more life to the noise. Methods for obtaining a harmonic sound from the noise are introduced. These methods take advantage of the stochastic nature of the model, facilitating a gradual change from the stochastic sound to the noisy harmonic sound.

The resulting instruments, in particular the Buchla, emphasised possibilities for the creation of musical structure in combination with components designed to enable real-time, expressive interaction. As smaller, keyboard-based synthesiser instruments achieved broad commercial success, many of the possibilities for the real-time creation and manipulation of musical structures, developed in the larger modular synthesiser designs, were not carried forward into the new age of commercial electronic music instruments. The resurgence of the modular synthesiser has seen these possibilities for improvisation of musical structures revisited, opening up processes and approaches that were almost lost to a new generation. Following an analysis of the genesis of modular synthesisers, with a focus on the Buchla, this article describes three examples of modular synthesiser-based compositional processes that enable the performer to undertake improvised actions in real time that construct, influence and distort musical structure. These examples are then analysed to better understand the processes, motivations and experiences of using a modular synthesiser to construct musical structure in a real-time and improvised fashion.","2022-08","2023-07-11 06:11:49","2023-07-11 06:11:49","2023-07-11 06:11:50","182-192","","2","27","","","Unstable Structure","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/SH3JX8BZ/White - 2022 - Unstable Structure The improvising modular synthe.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, non-anthropocentric views are proliferating within the interdisciplinary area of critical post-humanism, with emphasis on non-dualistic views on relations between human and technology. This article shows how such a view can inform electroacoustic and computer music practice, and sees improvisation linked with composition as a fruitful avenue in this. Following a philosophical preparation and a discussion of relevant music discourse, two computer music works created by the author are discussed to demonstrate a model of music-making that merges composition and improvisation, based on the concepts of cognitive assemblages and intra-action, following the writings of N. Katherine Hayles and Karen Barad, respectively. The works employ techniques related to artificial intelligence and cybernetics, such as machine learning algorithms, agent-based organisation and feedback systems. It is argued that acousmatic sound is an important aspect of this practice. The research is thus situated not only in the frames of improvisation practice and music technology but also within spatial acousmatic composition and performance.","2021-04","2023-07-11 06:11:49","2023-07-11 06:11:49","2023-07-11 06:11:50","31-41","","1","26","","","Strange Post-human Attractors","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/4DKBASJS/Nyström - 2021 - Strange Post-human Attractors Algorithmic improvi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Investigating works that borrow and thrive upon existing sound sources presents an array of issues regarding terminology, authorship and creativity. Embedding borrowed elements into new electroacoustic music goes beyond the simplicity of ‘cut and paste’ as composers approach this practice with new and novel techniques. Musical borrowings have been widely studied in fields of popular and classical music, from cover songs to quotations and from pastiches to theme and variations; however, borrowings that take place within the field of electroacoustic music can be less clear or defined, and demand a closer look. Because the components and building blocks of electroacoustic music are often recorded sound, the categories of borrowing become vast; thus incidences of borrowing, in some shape or form, can appear inevitable or unavoidable when composing. The author takes on this issue and proposes a new framework for categorising borrowings as a helpful aid for others looking to sample in new compositional work, as well as for further musicological study. The article will consider the compositional process of integration and reworking of borrowed material, using a repertoire study to showcase the variety of techniques in play when sound materials change hands, composer to composer. Terminology already in use by others to describe sound borrowing in electroacoustic music will be investigated in an effort to show the multitude of considerations and components in action when borrowing takes place. Motivations for borrowing, borrowing types, borrowing durations, copying as imitation, and composers’ reflections upon borrowing will all be considered within the article, along with discussions on programmatic development and embedding techniques. At the heart of this article, the author aims to show how widespread and pervasive borrowing is within the electroacoustic repertoire by drawing attention to varieties of sound transplants, all considered as acts of borrowing.","2019-08","2023-07-11 06:12:51","2023-07-11 06:12:51","2023-07-11 06:12:51","139-156","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/Z5284WUG/Blackburn - 2019 - The Terminology of Borrowing.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the second half of the century these tools were adopted by composers and musicians in many musical genres and have become commonplace and in some musics, ubiquitous. The perceived musical relationship between instrument and its electronic ‘other’ has been discussed largely from the point of view of listener and composer. This paper focuses on the performers’ perspective through reflection on and discussion of the author’s working methods in improvising duo contexts. The author suggests ‘estrangement’ as a term to describe and understand aspects of the performer’s experience of live transformation and discusses how this estrangement might influence the relationship between musicians and the resulting musical interaction in improvisation, and finally offers ‘co-estrangement’ as a description of his shared experience in such improvising duos.","2021-04","2023-07-11 06:12:51","2023-07-11 06:12:51","2023-07-11 06:12:51","42-51","","1","26","","","‘Making Life Lively’","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/WUWYS9G9/MacDonald - 2021 - ‘Making Life Lively’ Co-estrangement in live elec.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It prescribes actions to be carried out by the computer, often by systems called interpreters. When code is used to write music, we are therefore operating with programming language as a relatively new form of musical notation. Music is a time-based art form and the traditional musical score is a linear chronograph with instructions for an interpreter. Here code and traditional notation are somewhat at odds, since code is written as text, without any representational timeline. This can pose problems, for example for a composer who is working on a section in the middle of a long piece, but has to repeatedly run the code from the beginning or make temporary arrangements to solve this difficulty in the compositional process. In short: code does not come with a timeline but is rather the material used for building timelines. This article explores the context of creating linear ‘code scores’ in the area of musical notation. It presents the Threnoscope as an example of a system that implements both representational notation and a prescriptive code score.","2014-12","2023-07-11 06:12:51","2023-07-11 06:12:51","2023-07-11 06:12:51","268-275","","3","19","","","Scoring with Code","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/ZTD3HSZB/Magnusson - 2014 - Scoring with Code Composing with algorithmic nota.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These mechanisms take inspiration from processes found in Darwinian-based evolution theory, genetic algorithm theory and similar aesthetically based uses of a genetic search heuristic in the visual arts. A formal model of ‘musical evolution’ is proposed, with particular emphasis placed on the ways in which a genetic algorithm can be used to effectively manipulate a variety of compositional structures within a hierarchical and generative grammar-based model of musical composition.

Not only are we years away from modelling the former, we do not even begin to understand it. The latter is algorithmic in nature and has been modelled in many systems both musical and non-musical. Algorithmic composition is as old as music composition. It is often considered a cheat, a way out when the composer needs material and/or inspiration. It can also be thought of as a compositional tool that simply makes the composer’s work go faster. This article makes a case for algorithmic composition as such a tool. The ‘hard work’ type of creativity often involves trying many different combinations and choosing one over the others. It seems natural to express this iterative task as a computer algorithm. The implementation issues can be reduced to two components: how to understand one’s own creative process well enough to reproduce it as an algorithm, and how to program a computer to differentiate between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ music.

This has led to the emergence of a multitude of analytical methods, including aesthesical analysis, which approaches music from the point of view of perception, and poietical analysis, which pays attention to the creative process.This study aims to combine these two methods of analysis in order to understand the relationship between technology and the actual piece of music. The article presents a methodological approach – focused on six pieces produced at IRCAM in Paris and at CSC in Padua, between 1975 and 1985 – via an in-depth consideration of Mauro Graziani's Winter leaves, a work conceived in 1980 at the CSC using Music360. The method used consists of comparing data collected using a diversity of practices: repeated listening, the tracing of graphical schematics, sonogram and spectrogram analysis, data listing analysis. An algorithm has also been created in order to calculate the degree to which the software is exploited and to enable a comparison between the different analyses. It is hoped that this procedure will combine traditional musicological methods with new approaches suited to the medium and grounded in a thorough knowledge of computer technology and musical environments.","2004-04","2023-07-11 06:12:51","2023-07-11 06:12:51","2023-07-11 06:12:51","35-46","","1","9","","","Searching for lost data","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/ZI628ZQD/Zattra - 2004 - Searching for lost data outlines of aesthesic–poi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Ear Talk project currently exists in two distinct implementations, one that repurposes YouTube’s live-streaming technology, and one that utilises a stand-alone website. Although Ear Talk was conceived prior to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the necessity for remote collaboration became more apparent during the lockdown, when a vast majority of live events and music concerts were cancelled. The Ear Talk project enables a socially distanced form of online musical collaboration and offers a platform through which to respond to such a crisis, and has grown to be adopted and presented by many different performing groups across the world. In addition to describing the technical implementations of these two systems, we discuss issues that arise from our participatory practice: from musical quality concerns in regard to social aesthetics and artistic ingenuity, to accessibility concerns when designing technologically mediated collaborative systems. Ear Talk embraces continuous musical loops as well as highly asynchronous (i.e., perpetual) collaborative paradigms among remote participants, which raises a conceptual inquiry as to which part of its sonic and social experience constitutes music in the end. Finally, we evaluate performer–audience relationships (i.e., hierarchical versus horizontal interactions) and the efficacy of the Ear Talk systems at enabling socially engaged co-composition.","2023-04","2023-07-11 06:12:51","2023-07-11 06:12:51","2023-07-11 06:12:51","110-121","","1","28","","","Ear Talk Project","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/TLU4NWG5/Tsuruoka et al. - 2023 - Ear Talk Project Participatory co-composition on .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More specifically the article addresses related experimental practices in these distinct yet related fields of electronic music-making. The democratisation of music technology continues to expand into an increasingly diverse set of musical fields, destabilising established power dynamics. A flexible, structured approach to the analysis of these relationships facilitates the navigation of crumbling boundaries and shifting relationships. Contemporary electronic music’s overlapping networks encompass varying forms of capital, aesthetics, technology, ideology, tools and techniques. These areas offer interesting points of convergence. As the discourse surrounding electronic music expands, so must the vocabulary and conceptual models used to describe and discuss new areas of converging artistic practice. Genre level diagrams selectively collapse, expand and arrange artistic fields, facilitating concrete, coherent arguments and the examination of patterns and relationships. Through the genre level diagram’s establishment of distinct yet flexible boundaries, electronic music’s sprawling discourse can be cordoned off, expanded or contracted to suit structured analyses. In this way, this approach clarifies scope and facilitates simultaneous examination from a variety of perspectives.","2016-04","2023-07-11 06:12:51","2023-07-11 06:12:51","2023-07-11 06:12:51","61-71","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/XN7S4NJQ/Britton - 2016 - Genre and Capital in Avant-garde Electronica.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The term transcontextuality indicates that a sound has a dual meaning, which refers both to the musical context created by the composer and to its original, natural or cultural context. The concept of transcontextuality is particularly rewarding because a substantial part of Stilleben's sound material is drawn from an earlier composition by Saariaho, Lichtbogen. The focus of the study is in defining the ways the composition refers to time outside of the musical time of Stilleben itself. These references are divided into two categories: (i) references to the musical time of Lichtbogen, and (ii) references to the passage of time in a non-musical context. The first category leads to a music analytical approach where dominance/subordination relations of the time structures of the two compositions in question are studied. It is concluded that the temporal structure of Stilleben is defined by the temporality of Lichtbogen on various structural levels. The second category gives rise to reasoning with respect to narrative interpretation: environmental sounds convey stories and thus refer directly to the passage of time.","1996-08","2023-07-11 06:12:51","2023-07-11 06:12:51","2023-07-11 06:12:51","87-92","","2","1","","","Displaced time","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/H84KQ6UA/Kankaanpää - 1996 - Displaced time transcontextual references to time.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article argues that musical sounds are not just material objects, and that musical notations, on paper or in computer code, are not just symbolic abstractions, but instructions for embodied actions. When notation is employed computationally to control resonance and gestural actuators at multiple acoustic, psychoacoustic and conceptual levels of music form, vibrant sonic morphologies may emerge from the quantum-like boundaries between them.

Even if Xenakis recommended to apprentice composers who came to study with him ‘listen to a lot of music and write’ (Serrou 2003: 20), this machine, since its inception, has enabled a large number of people to access music composition, because it does not require any preliminary theoretical training. Based on this observation we ask how UPIC, capable of converting a drawing into sound in real-time, upset the perception of musical pedagogy not only in Europe but also worldwide, through the many workshops/concerts offered to a wide audience. Exchanges and emulation around this invention are discussed as well.After describing the technical development of this tool and, by extension, Xenakis's pedagogical thinking, we will highlight some of the most significant encounters between the machine and the public thanks to many unpublished sources found in the archives of the Centre Iannis Xenakis (CIX) recently deposited at the University of Rouen. We will highlight the pedagogical correlation between sound theory, gesture and image involved in the composition of a UPIC score.

Decades after the work of Pierre Schaeffer to theorise the objet sonore – sound object – and John Cage’s (1973: 10) call to ‘let sounds be themselves’, there remain few ontological and epistemological frameworks to support investigations into aesthetic, ethical and political questions related to experimental music practice and the place of sound in it. This makes writing about sound difficult and contributes to a lack of clarity or specificity in the use of terms such as ‘sound’, ‘noise’ and ‘silence’. In this article I seek to address this, connecting the work of transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau, experimental music composer and thinker Cage and philosopher Michel Serres with my own experience to develop an account of sound in experimental music that approaches it as multiplicity. This allows sound to be heard as physical, perceptual and conceptual and brings into question the reproducibility of sound, emphasising the place of sound as part of its environment.","2017-12","2023-07-11 06:15:30","2023-07-11 06:15:30","2023-07-11 06:15:30","362-368","","3","22","","","Sound as Multiplicity","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/NBL6JPHK/Byrne - 2017 - Sound as Multiplicity Listening with Thoreau, Cag.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The discussion begins by focusing on technological processes, including accelerated change, cycles of enhancement, obsolescence, retrieval and reversal, and the non-neutrality of technology. This is followed by a focus on musical issues resulting from the decoupling of sound control from sound production, interactivity, the expansion towards time-based media and the possible active role of audiences in the realisation of music. Discussion is then posited within the wider cultural context of modernism and the postmodern era, the eroding popular/art divide and the obsolescence of music as a cultural artefact resulting from technological change. This leads to the conclusion, which identifies tentative learning outcomes that may be helpful in formulating future strategic decisions.","2015-04","2023-07-11 06:15:30","2023-07-11 06:15:30","2023-07-11 06:15:30","23-29","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/Q25MN45K/Fischman - 2015 - What Do We Know that Varèse Didn’t.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It aims to provide a framework and terminology for the discussion, analysis and creation of music that articulates mimetic discourse and structure. In doing so, it also intends to enable parallel and complementary analytical approaches to those concerned with the aural and spatial aspects of musical articulation. It proposes the notion of multidimensional mimetic space, taking as its point of departure Emmerson's Language Grid (Emmerson 1986), and constructing additional axes representing compositional continua, similar in function to those proposed by spectromorphology (Smalley 1986), but applicable to mimetic material. The argument considers the mimetic implications of both purely acousmatic music and works that combine the acousmatic with live performance. After a brief consideration of the relationship between mimetic space and space-form (Smalley 2007a), the discussion concludes with a perspective on narrative as a component of mimetic space; providing an extensive discussion of issues pertinent to the idea of signifier space, which was originally introduced in the preceding paper.","2008-08","2023-07-11 06:15:30","2023-07-11 06:15:30","2023-07-11 06:15:30","111-122","","2","13","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/MGVWH6Q4/Fischman - 2008 - Mimetic Space – Unravelled.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whilst most higher music education institutions provide opportunities for composers to explore computer-based techniques for live audio processing, it is rare for performers to receive any formal training in live electronic music as part of their study. The first experience of live electronics for many performers is during final preparation for a concert. If a performer is to give a convincing musical interpretation ‘with’ and not simply ‘into’ the electronics, significant insight and preparation are required. At Birmingham Conservatoire we explored two distinct methods for teaching live electronics to performers between 2010 and 2012: training workshops aimed at groups of professional performers, and a curriculum pilot project aimed at augmenting undergraduate instrumental lessons. In this paper we present the details of these training methods followed by the qualitative results of specific case studies and a post-training survey. We discuss the survey results in the context of tacit knowledge gained through delivery of these programmes, and finally suggest recommendations and possibilities for future research.","2013-08","2023-07-11 06:15:30","2023-07-11 06:15:30","2023-07-11 06:15:30","170-177","","2","18","","","Live Electronics in Practice","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/ILLBDDDZ/Bullock et al. - 2013 - Live Electronics in Practice Approaches to traini.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An EDM track and its related YouTube comments are analysed concurrently in order to examine how sound-shapes and sonic spatiality are experienced in practice on the social web. Using Stephen Feld’s notion of acoustemology as a theoretical base, I argue that semantic and somantic ways of knowing through sound are thoroughly entangled. A hybrid acoustemology model is outlined, merging spectromorphology and space-form with elements of ecosemiotics and music psychology. The model is then deployed during an acoustemology of the trance/breakbeat track Finished Symphony by Hybrid (1999). Selected YouTube comments on Finished Symphony uploads are coded deductively using the descriptive system of Gabrielsson and Wik (2003). A larger set of comments is subsequently collected for inductive content analysis, which highlights some wider issues relating to the words we use for music and sound. The article concludes by calling for vantage point shifts in music research.","2017-12","2023-07-11 06:15:30","2023-07-11 06:15:30","2023-07-11 06:15:30","324-335","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/4VT8F7AY/Spencer - 2017 - Re-orientating Spectromorphology and Space-form th.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although often seen as working at the periphery of this movement, this paper argues that Schaeffer's effort to ground musical works in a ‘hybrid discipline’ is quite orthodox, modelled upon Husserl's foundational critique of both ‘realism’ and ‘psychologism’. As part of this orthodoxy, Schaeffer develops his notion of the ‘sound object’ along essentialist (eidetic) lines. This has two consequences: first, an emphasis is placed on ‘reduced listening’ over indicative and communicative modes of listening; secondly, the ‘sound object’ promotes an ahistorical ontology of musical material and technology. Despite frequent references to Schaeffer and the ‘sound object’ in recent literature on networked music, concatenative synthesis and high-level music descriptors, the original phenomenological context in which Schaeffer's work developed is rarely revisited. By critically exploring Schaeffer's theorising of the ‘sound object’, this paper aims at articulating the distance between contemporary and historical usage of the term.","2007-04","2023-07-11 06:15:30","2023-07-11 06:15:30","2023-07-11 06:15:30","15-24","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/VB6VGRTY/Kane - 2007 - L’Objet Sonore Maintenant.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Discovery Strategy provides a steering mechanism which directs first-time listeners towards identifying features that lie beneath the surface of the music. A key component of this mechanism is the skilful integration of familiar sounds into more abstract contexts. The implementation of the strategy rests on a consideration of how different listeners perceive music through time, and how their perception changes over repeated listenings. The tape work Undercurrents (Field 1994) follows these principles, demonstrating that it is not necessary to compromise structural sophistication while pursuing Discovery Strategy methods.","1996-08","2023-07-11 06:15:30","2023-07-11 06:15:30","2023-07-11 06:15:30","119-123","","2","1","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/4NTMP57A/Field - 1996 - An introduction to Discovery Strategy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the most simple case, digital music simulates something that does not exist as a reality; it generates something new. It is the result of the teamwork of numerous authorities such as the 'musician', the programmer and the authority of the software program. Today, computer digital music can be seen as screen-based music, i.e. sounds become visible and images audible, but one can often forget that there is no mutual correspondence; and that this is simply a mechanism whereby a given program secretly directs the programmer towards significant ways of performing, creating apparently absolute relationships between image and sound. On the other hand, with the increasing complexity of software, the programmer loses insight into internal communication structures. Such complex programs are full of errors and can even act on their own initiative. Programmers and musicians who navigate through today's systems function as designers. But this is less a question of the design of a program's operation surfaces but of the programming of software and the navigation by its logic. One has to discuss the medial conditions of digital music, the more user-friendly the software, the less transparent is the medium itself; i.e. the more transparent the functions of a computer or a synthesizer (say, with the use of preset sounds), the stronger the medium proves to be non-transparent. Digital music is more about opening up given program structures; internal ramifications and program hierarchies are to be discovered.","2001-12","2023-07-11 06:15:30","2023-07-11 06:15:30","2023-07-11 06:15:30","225-228","","3","6","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/47I283HD/Szepanski - 2001 - A Mille Plateaux manifesto.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These field recordings are not site specific in the conventional sense because they are not tied to a particular architectural or listening space. Nor can field recordings be categorised as just another subgenre of experimental electronic music. Whereas in musique concrète and acousmatic music, sounds are organised according to musical or thematic parameters, López’s and Tsunoda’s field recording sounds are subjected to minimal editing and processing, and are organised according to the innate traits of the sounds themselves.It would be insufficient, however, to offer the usual conciliatory conclusion that López’s and Tsunoda’s recordings straddle the sound art/music divide by possessing qualities of both. This article argues that these field recordings can best be understood in relation to the visual arts concept of objecthood, Michael Fried’s term for deciphering minimalist sculpture of the late 1960s. Objecthood explains how these field recordings use appropriated sounds that are nonetheless treated as non-referential, autonomous materials.

The book presents a detailed account of the technical and creative evolution of electronic music from its earliest days. Starting from Thaddeus Cahill’s 1897 patent application for the Dynamophone, it traces developments in North America and Europe and discusses a range of analogue techniques including tape manipulation and voltage-controlled synthesisers. Later chapters consider the digital revolution that followed, including developments in MIDI and digital workstations. In later editions, the sections on computer music were significantly revised and expanded to reflect the major and rapid transformation of the field. A distinctive feature of the book is the way it combines detailed historical information and thorough explanations of technical developments, often clarified by use of explanatory diagrams, with insightful accounts of the musical repertoire produced using this technology. The book was derived from Peter’s PhD thesis at Durham University in which he surveyed and analysed numerous contemporaneous texts documenting developments in minute detail.","2022-08","2023-07-11 06:16:56","2023-07-11 06:16:56","2023-07-11 06:16:56","267-269","","2","27","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/CXEPQZHC/Clarke et al. - 2022 - Peter Manning 1948–2022.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, at present it is rarely practised in electroacoustic music, which can partly be explained by the nature of electronic technology and current thinking about authenticity. Despite this context, there are benefits to performance opportunities through the diversity created by arrangement; therefore, the process of adapting the electroacoustics of Scelsi's Aitsi is explored. The work offers this opportunity, since it lacks precision in its musical documentation, has received a number of quite different renditions and shows ontological malleability as it exists in another form, Scelsi's Fifth String Quartet. The new electroacoustic adaptation exploits Max/MSP software to extend the electroacoustic treatment of the piano beyond previous interpretations, whilst attempting to remain consistent with the aesthetic of the work.

This text intends to introduce a discussion about the many possibilities offered by the morphology of interaction between acoustic sources and electroacoustic resources and structures.

I outline a set of practices which can be more accurately described as site-responsive, rather than site-specific. I develop a methodological framework for site-responsive live electronic music in three stages. First, I discuss the ambiguity of the term site-specific by drawing on its origins within the visual arts and providing examples of how it has been used within sound art. I then suggest that site-responsive performance might be a more helpful way of describing this type of activity. I argue that it affords an opportunity for music to mediate the social, drawing on Small’s idea of music as sets of third-order relationships, and Bourriaud’s relational aesthetics. Third, I suggest that with the current renewed trend for performances occurring outside of cultural institutions, it is important to be mindful of the identity of a particular site, and those who have a cultural connection to it.

This investigation starts with a fundamental presumption: composers, generally speaking, think in the future – their compositions will be performed and perceived at a different and later time than that of the compositional act, and will be listened by other persons. The hypothesis I develop in this article is that the musical work determines a deferred relationship between the listener and the composer, and that the compositional act is basically a dialogical act. Paul Ricœur’s theory of mimesis is helpful in analysing this dialogical mechanism through the notion of ‘temporal configuration’. By drawing on this theoretical framework, I interviewed five composers in order to make explicit the imbrication of the composer’s and listener’s temporalities in the musical work. This exploratory inquiry allowed for a concrete analysis, articulated in the words of the composers, of how they conceive the relationship between their compositional temporality and that expressed by their work.","2020-08","2023-07-11 06:16:56","2023-07-11 06:16:56","2023-07-11 06:16:56","179-186","","2","25","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/UXK75LGZ/Maestri - 2020 - An Exploratory Inquiry into the Relationship betwe.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Subscribing to this view also confronts music and sound art as consistent autonomous categories and focuses on how the pieces attune to the environment, emphasising meetings, transformations and translations through and with other objects. These meetings generate an ecological awareness of causal aesthetics where objects time and space each other. This contrasts with traditional analysis of music and sound art, which is based on the assumption that time and space are containers in which sound and music unfold.

Capdeville’s works include different elements such as music, settings (staging), movement, text, tape-recorded sound, visual image, props, costumes and lighting. Documentation for the compositions is scattered across different sources or simply lost, making it difficult to reconstruct the works as they have improvised hypothetical components and idiosyncratic or non-standard notations. Using a type of musicological archeology, I want to contribute to the understanding of gesture, language and communication in Capdeville’s works. I aim to preserve the works, particularly by highlighting the collaborative approach of the composer and proposing ways of establishing a documentation process for these aspects in order to systematise the works. I focus on the use of technology of magnetic tape as both a source of listening (the tapes provide a recording of the entire performance) and an instrument (tape recordings are given parts in the composition of the piece). Technology is also an important analytical tool because it helps to track collaborative creative processes.

An older model designed for analysis of complex twentieth-century acoustic works is updated to incorporate varied profiles of electroacoustic music. Recent research in auditory systems corroborates that we receive different types of information simultaneously through different channels, each taking more or less periodic sampling from different bands of frequencies – from timbre to phrase length and beyond. In order to acknowledge both the primitive structures of our complex hearing mechanisms and the different profiles of listeners, it is suggested that this multiple-sampling strategy may operate in a parallel way at a much larger scale, thereby allowing us to integrate the listener’s preference for pacing, contrast and densities of activity into the sensory processing of a musical work. The article is enriched by insights from soundscape pioneer Hildegard Westerkamp relating to various aspects of the discussion, from sensory overload to ecological concerns to the natural rallentando of a soundwalk. Finally, a whimsical elaboration based on the analogy of time as a river is presented in order to incorporate a more organic set of characteristics into our appreciation of music and time.","2020-08","2023-07-11 06:16:56","2023-07-11 06:16:56","2023-07-11 06:16:56","259-268","","2","25","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/DGL6YRWJ/Mountain - 2020 - Elaborating Analogies of Time Perception.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Metaphorically, when we hear of noise being generated, we understand it to be something extraneous. Historically, though, noise has just as often signalled music, or pleasing sound, as its opposite. In the twentieth century, the notion of a clear line between elements suitable for compositional use (i.e. notes, created on instruments) and the world of noises was broken down.

The methods did not allow for many conclusions, but the approach started a new field of research, where diverse listening behaviours could serve as a basis for diverse, exclusive (or even contradictory) analyses of the same work. Furthermore, Delalande’s preliminary research based on an extract from Pierre Henry’s music is still one of the few instances of research into acousmatic music listening that addresses actual listeners. The last 20 years have seen the reproduction and extension of Delalande’s results, as well as a growing interest in listening in musicological circles. For this reason, it seemed necessary to review research about listening behaviours to evaluate their operational validity and to propose a robust theoretical framework for their study and description. This paper addresses this problem using the elicitation interview for the description and interpretation of listeners’ testimonies. Drawing on testimonies from five listeners about a single extract of acousmatic music, it seems that, for Delalande’s model to be able to describe various listening experiences, it should be further detailed and completed with attention management processes. Further investigation is needed to allow the model to include some listening behaviours which were not recurrent enough here to make sense of them.","2019-04","2023-07-11 06:18:21","2023-07-11 06:18:21","2023-07-11 06:18:21","8-19","","1","24","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/WHIMVJAJ/Marty - 2019 - The Study of Acousmatic Listening Behaviours.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This conflict challenges the perceived boundaries that differentiate genres, and also challenges the significance of existing ‘instrumental’ definitions of interactive computer music to the author's work. The author's approach to investigating this issue through composition is discussed, using two pieces as examples: Words on the streets are these (2001), an interactive installation, and Still Life (2002), a concert piece for string quartet and live electroacoustics. Technical and aesthetic aspects are outlined, specifically in relation to the experience of the spectator-listener.

The present article seeks to demonstrate the similarities between the studio compositional methods of Jamaican dub innovator King Tubby and those of Canadian soundscape composers Barry Truax and Hildegard Westerkamp. Rather than attempting to identify aesthetic and stylistic similarities between Tubby’s dub music and soundscape composition, this article presents a comparative analysis of dub in relation to soundscape composition focusing on artistic articulations of contextual meaning and acoustic communication. Specifically, this work argues that Tubby’s compositional approach directly addresses the following conceptual themes common in soundscape composition: 1) referential composition and the invocation of past listening associations through sonic abstraction, 2) timbral play as a means of linking sound processing to acoustic communication, and 3) the evocation of real-world motion cues by way of ecologically informed sound-processing effects. Exploring the conceptual similarities between Tubby’s work and the established academic-affiliated genre of soundscape composition provides a new perspective on his work as reflecting a multifaceted musical approach that warrants further scholarly study.","2018-04","2023-07-11 06:18:21","2023-07-11 06:18:21","2023-07-11 06:18:21","91-100","","1","23","","","Sounding Riddims","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/5J9DIH3U/Yoganathan and Chapman - 2018 - Sounding Riddims King Tubby’s dub in the context .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I argue that this dualism prevents many works of sound art from being fully appreciated. My subsequent attempt of finding a basis for a more comprehensive aesthetic of acoustic art forms is helped along by Trevor Wishart’s concept of ‘sonic art’. I follow Wishart’s insight that the status of music was changed by the invention of sound recording and go on to argue that an even more important ontological consequence of recording was the new possibility of storing and manipulating any acoustic event. This media-historic condition, which I refer to as ‘recordability’, spawned three distinct art forms with different degrees of abstraction – electroacoustic music in the tradition of Pierre Schaeffer, gallery-oriented sound art and radiogenic Ars Acustica. Introducing Ars Acustica, or radio art, as a third term provides some perspective on the music/sound art binarism. A brief look at the history of radio art aims at substantiating my claim that all art forms based on recordable sounds can be fruitfully discussed by appreciating their shared technological basis and the multiplicity of their reference systems rather than by subsuming one into another.","2015-08","2023-07-11 06:18:21","2023-07-11 06:18:21","2023-07-11 06:18:21","200-206","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/FR8KRC84/Fiebig - 2015 - Acoustic Art Forms in the Age of Recordability.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approach is influenced by the field of science and technology studies (STS, also science technology and society) where technical and cultural entanglements are seen as crafting particular truths, and where the method of following a technology across disciplinary boundaries is found. By taking this approach to identify connections between the areas of electronic music, sound art and kinetic art, new and rediscovered critical appraisals of the use of electromechanical technologies as tools in creative sound production are identified.

The most recent development is digital augmentation: the organ sound is captured, transformed and then played back in real time. The present augmented organ project relies on three main aesthetic principles: microphony, fusion and instrumentality. Microphony means that sounds are captured inside the organ case, close to the pipes. Real-time audio effects are then applied to the internal sounds before they are played back over loudspeakers; the transformed sounds interact with the original sounds of the pipe organ. The fusion principle exploits the blending effect of the acoustic space surrounding the instrument; the room response transforms the sounds of many single-sound sources into a consistent and organ-typical soundscape at the listener’s position. The instrumentality principle restricts electroacoustic processing to organ sounds only, excluding non-organ sound sources or samples. This article proposes a taxonomy of musical effects. It discusses aesthetic questions concerning the perceptual fusion of acoustic and electronic sources. Both extended playing techniques and digital audio can create musical gestures that conjoin the heterogeneous sonic worlds of pipe organs and electronics. This results in a paradoxical listening experience of unity in the diversity: the music is at the same time electroacoustic and instrumental.","2019-04","2023-07-11 06:18:21","2023-07-11 06:18:21","2023-07-11 06:18:21","41-53","","1","24","","","Of Pipes and Patches","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/9IXSF9WZ/d’Alessandro and Noisternig - 2019 - Of Pipes and Patches Listening to augmented pipe .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is true, the history of music clearly attests to the temptation and of the ‘pleasure’ (as Aristotle also says) found in mimesis. We know that very lately in history musique concrète gives a new perspective to this question as well as to other questions, and changes the deal: because the sound objects of the world, of the whole world – the ‘noises’ – that needed to be imitated, can now be easily captured through technology, almost in a photographic way, and then they can be gathered, kept, and finally be composed. Hopefully Pierre Schaeffer, its genial inventor, has, concerning the question of nature within new music, a position that tears him apart, which is paradoxical, uncomfortable, fundamental: that the nature that is so easily captured, he does not want to exhibit; to understand the lessons, the hidden musical lessons, he only wants to examine it. This almost heroic model will only be partially followed by the composers (concrète, electroacoustic, acousmatic, anecdotical composers) who have been working during the last sixty years in this passionate domain.

Rather, he both employs Schaeffer’s methodology and subverts it, systematically demonstrating the potential and the limitations of Schaeffer’s epoché and its product, the sound object. The result is what might be aptly termed the ‘unsound object’: a sonic entity which both demonstrates and defies Schaeffer’s ideals, and exemplifies the rich ambiguities which can arise from the compositional exploitation of referentiality and association, in addition to the intrinsic, morphological characteristics emphasised within Schaeffer’s reduced listening. Throughout his engagement with Schaefferian theory, however, Harrison never abandons the fundamental musical radicalism at the heart of Schaeffer’s project: positing ‘concrete sound material’, rather than ‘abstract concept’, as the basis for the language of electroacoustic music (Chion 1983: 37).","2015-12","2023-07-11 06:18:21","2023-07-11 06:18:21","2023-07-11 06:18:21","300-307","","3","20","","","Unsound Phenomenologies","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/ABER3XI8/Herrmann - 2015 - Unsound Phenomenologies Harrison, Schaeffer and t.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In computer music research, most current sound design tools allow the direct manipulation of visual representations of sound such as time-domain and frequency-domain representations, with the most notable examples being the UPIC system (Xenakis 1992), Phonogramme (Lesbros 1996), Lemur (Fitz and Haken 1997), and MetaSynth (Wenger 1998), among others.

The examples suggest that technological innovation may be relatively unimportant to the most innovative and musically adventurous pop musicians. Rather, they appear to need to have established some kind of relationship with their equipment before they find radically new ways of using it.

The sonorous object is a fragment of sound, typically in the range of a few seconds (often even less), perceived as a unit. Sonorous objects are constituted, studied, and evaluated according to various criteria, and sonorous objects that are found suitable are regarded as musical objects that may be used in musical composition. In the selection and qualification of these sonorous objects, we are encouraged to practise what Schaeffer called ‘reduced listening’, meaning disregarding the original context of the sound, including its source and signification, and instead focus our listening on the sonorous features.However, it can be argued that this principle of ‘reduced listening’ is not in conflict with more fundamental principles of embodied cognition, and that the criteria for the constitution, and the various feature qualifications, of sonorous objects can be linked to gestural images. Also, there are several similarities between studying sound and gestures from a phenomenological perspective, and it is suggested that Schaeffer's theoretical concepts may be extended to what is called gestural-sonorous objects.","2006-08","2023-07-11 06:19:51","2023-07-11 06:19:51","2023-07-11 06:19:51","149-157","","2","11","","","Gestural-Sonorous Objects","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/QZMLAIXU/Godøy - 2006 - Gestural-Sonorous Objects embodied extensions of .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Oram's background in both music and electronics was to prove invaluable in this regard, and her appointment as the founding director of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop in 1958, having previously lobbied within the organisation for such a facility for several years, provides testament to her standing in both regards.

I propose four viewpoints that investigate the relationship between sites and sounds, where narratives are shaped and made through the exploration of specific sonic activities. These are: sonic narrative of space, sonic activism, sonic preservation and sonic participatory action.I examine each of these ideas, initially focusing in more detail on the first viewpoint, which provides the context for discussing and analysing a recent site-specific music improvisation project entitled ‘Museum City’, a work that aligns most closely with my proposal for a ‘sonic narrative of space’, while also bearing aspects of each of the other proposed viewpoints.The work ‘Museum City’ by Pedro Rebelo, Franziska Schroeder, Ricardo Jacinto and André Cepeda specifically enables me to reflect on how derelict and/or transitional spaces might be re-examined through the use of sound, particularly by means of live music improvisation. The spaces examined as part of ‘Museum City’ constitute either deserted sites or sites about to undergo changes in their architectural layout, their use and sonic make-up. The practice in ‘Museum City’ was born out of a performative engagement with(in) those sites, but specifically out of an intimate listening relationship by three improvisers situated within those spaces.The theoretical grounding for this article is situated within a wider context of practising and cognising musical spatiality, as proposed by Georgina Born (2013), particularly her proposition for three distinct lineages that provide an understanding of space in/and music. Born’s third lineage, which links more closely with practices of sound art and challenges a Euclidean orientation of pitch and timbre space, makes way for a heightened consideration of listening and ‘the place’ of sound. This lineage is particularly crucial for my discussion, since it positions music in relation to social experiences and the everyday, which the work ‘Museum City’ endeavoured to embrace.","2016-12","2023-07-11 06:19:51","2023-07-11 06:19:51","2023-07-11 06:19:51","249-259","","3","21","","","Museum City","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/76YFARHV/Schroeder - 2016 - Museum City Improvisation and the narratives of s.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However sophisticated the interface, nuances of face-to-face communication such as gesture, facial expression, and body language are not available to the remote improviser. Sound artists and musicians must rely on listening and the semiotics of sound to mediate their interaction and the resulting collaboration. This paper examines two case studies of networked improvisatory performances by the inter-cultural tele-music ensemble Ethernet Orchestra.It focuses on qualities of sound (e.g. timbre, frequency, amplitude) in the group's networked improvisation, examining how they become arbiters of meaning in dialogical musical interactions without visual gestural signifiers. The evaluation is achieved through a framework of Distributed Cognition, highlighting the centrality of culture, artefact and environment in the analysis of dispersed musical perception. It contrasts salient qualities of sound in the groups’ collective improvisation, highlighting the interpretive challenges for cross-cultural musicians in a real-time ‘jam’ session.

Conversely, the growing do-it-yourself (DIY) culture is subverting the manufacturer–consumer model. Regarding music, software such as Pure Data and Max/MSP allows users to build their own interactive systems. These factors contribute to the emergence of new digital musical instruments (DMI). However, DMI creation still requires a strong technical background. Based on the importance of prototyping in the process of designing things, this paper presents the Sketchument, an environment devoted to help non-technical users to easily prototype DMIs, using multiple input modes and allowing the integration to other useful technologies. From a lo-fi paper prototype, to functional ones, passing through movies, questionnaires, interviews, Sketchument has been developed following the same prototyping philosophy we intend to propose to its users. The cyclic process of design–implementation-evaluation has produced valuable feedback from potential users, which has been very useful to back design choices and to push modifications.","2013-12","2023-07-11 06:19:51","2023-07-11 06:19:51","2023-07-11 06:19:51","314-327","","3","18","","","Sketchument","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/LSLY48T2/Calegario et al. - 2013 - Sketchument Empowering users to build DMIs throug.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I am interested in what happens if we facilitate access to contemporary music for audiences of any kind of demographic, break down barriers, share authority between participating non-professionals and professional artists and allow all participants of a project influence on jointly created artworks. I investigate in how far the organisational or structural change in the creative practice and the creative outcome – that comes along with bringing new players into the field – has consequences on the personal practice of the professional actors in such a project. I base my article on theories of sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, communication scholar Henry Jenkins, art historian Claire Bishop, musicologist Elena Ungeheuer and my own research into social structures of the contemporary art field, and apply them to a single case study: the artistic research project TransCoding – From ‘Highbrow Art’ to Participatory Culture, funded by the Austrian Science Fund. Using the method of thick description, I take the reader through the history of TransCoding, give account of field experiences and put the found patterns of cultural-social experiences into a theoretical context. I investigate the power shifts from professional artists to audience that occurred on the basis of creative, participatory processes within this project. In doing so, I would like to raise questions and stimulate discussion with regard to the conditions and social organisations of creative practice in the contemporary music field, the distribution of power and how this is felt when ‘bringing new audiences to new music’ into the core practice of professional artists, the actual creation of a new work.","2019-12","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","289-296","","3","24","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/HTGU7PJJ/Lüneburg - 2019 - Empowerment and Disempowerment in the Participator.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under a new analytical framework that I call ‘sound pedagogy’, I trace a history of linguistic discourses about listening, from John Cage’s talking pieces to Fluxus text scores, Max Neuhaus’s soundwalks, R. Murray Schafer’s ear cleaning exercises and Pauline Oliveros’s Sonic Meditations. I show how all these artists attempt to transform auditory perception in the everyday life of the subject. A central debate here is whether this more ‘open’ listening should be viewed as a new, cultivated practice, or, more problematically, as a primordial condition to which we must return. Framed as a polemical antidote to our harmful auditory enculturation (which privileges Western art music and alienates us from potential auditory aesthesis in the lived space of daily life), these sound pedagogies are, as I will show, ripe for deconstruction and critique. Yet, more hopefully, they may also open up broader and more immediate forms of participation than Western art music has typically allowed.","2015-08","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","222-230","","2","20","","","Sound Pedagogy","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/SLX4QUZG/Tinkle - 2015 - Sound Pedagogy Teaching listening since Cage.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The author argues that the foregrounding of such scores, through their projection for an audience and meticulous design, draws especial attention to the manner in which such non-linear processes are represented and in turn decoded by performers. While the transparency of the decoding process is shown to vary across a wide spectrum, the central role of the notational schema in works such as these is shown to align them in many ways with a broader interface aesthetics, promoting rich fields of creative and artistic enquiry.","2014-12","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","286-294","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/V93YXLMH/Kim-Boyle - 2014 - Visual Design of Real-Time Screen Scores.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social distancing has impacted the vast majority of people, reorganising society, physically separating us from friends, family and colleagues. Collectively we found ourselves in a distributed state, reliant upon digital technologies to maintain social and professional connections. Some activities can translate unabated to a digital medium, with benefits, such as the convenience inherent in many online shopping and banking services. Other activities, particularly those which are socially engaged, including inclusive music-making or design, may need to be re-framed and re-thought due to the absence of in-person contact.In Northern Ireland, the Performance Without Barriers (PwB) research group works with disabled artists from the Drake Music Project Northern Ireland (DMNI) to identify ways in which technology can remove access barriers to music-making. Since disabled people are experts in their unique lived experience of disability, they must be involved in the design process, an approach known as participatory design. At the end of 2020, many of us are still adjusting to the new normal, only beginning to understand the impact of distributed digital living. In this article, we examine how the socially engaged work of PwB has been affected, changed and adapted during the pandemic throughout 2019 to 2020, expanding ideas of distributed creativity to the notion of distributed design. The authors formalise the concept of socially engaged distributed participatory design, an approach that classifies PwB’s current research activities in the area of accessible music technology design and improvised musicking. Consideration is given to the impact the notion of ‘distribution’ has on degrees of participation.","2021-08","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","219-229","","2","26","","","Distributed Participatory Design","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/PMYAIJ9R/Schroeder and Lucas - 2021 - Distributed Participatory Design The challenges o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The article’s contextual sections focus on briefly delineating this world of sonic creativity and placing it within today’s sampling culture as well as dealing with two political aspects of sampling, a musician’s attitude towards the reuse of sonic materials and the legality of sampled sounds, including musical passages, in the discussion of which current legislation related to sampling is challenged. Following this, a number of categories are presented in terms of the types of sampling material that is being used as well as how sample-based works are presented. The subsequent section is perhaps the most poignant in the article, namely the opening up of this form of innovative composition from a more traditional ‘artist creates work’ mode of operation to a more collaborative one which is essentially already part of most other forms of sampling culture. The objective here is to suggest that such collaborative approaches will enable sample-based sound-based music to become part of the lives of a much broader group than those currently involved with it.","2019-08","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","130-138","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/9EJVUCJQ/Landy - 2019 - Re-composing Sounds … and Other Things.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Often these systems are designed to elicit a reaction in a very broad way, relying on segmenting and playing back audio material according to a fixed or mobile set of rules or analysis. As a result, such systems can produce an outcome that sounds generic across different improvisers, or restrict meaningful electroacoustic improvisation to those performers with a matching capacity for designing improvisatory electroacoustic processing. This article documents the development of an improvisatory electroacoustic instrument for pianist Maria Donohue as a collaborative process for music-making. The Donohue+ program is a bespoke electroacoustic improvisatory system designed to augment the performance capabilities of Maria, enabling her to achieve new possibilities in live performance. Through the process of development, Maria’s performative style, within the broader context of free improvisation, was analysed and used to design an interactive electronic system. The end result of this process is a meaningful augmentation of the piano in accordance with Maria’s creative practice, differing significantly from other improvising electroacoustic instruments she has previously experimented with. Through the process of development, Donohue+ identifies a practice for instrument design that engages not only with a performer’s musical materials but also with a broader free improvisation aesthetic.","2021-04","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","129-139","","1","26","","","Donohue+","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/AQTWC3KR/Gillies and Donohue - 2021 - Donohue+ Developing performer-specific electronic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multi-stranded investigations of connections are identified within the conception, composition, realisation and reception of these works. Performer perspectives are given through two case studies.

Today the growing ubiquity of visual 3D technologies gives artists a similar opportunity in the realm of visual music. With the use of stereoscopic video we now have the ability to compose individual depth cues independently. The process of continuous change of the perceived depth of the audiovisual space over time is being referred to as depth modulation, and can only be fully appreciated through motion.What can be achieved through the separation and manipulation of visual and sonic spatial cues? What can we learn about the way we perceive space if the basic components building our understanding of the surrounding environment are artificially split and re-arranged?Visual music appears to be a perfect field for such experimentation. Strata of visual and aural depth cues can be used to create audiovisual counterpoints in three-dimensional spaces. The choice of abstract imagery and the lack of obvious narrative storylines allow us to focus our perception on the evolution of the immersive audiovisual space itself. A new language of an immersive audiovisual medium should emerge as a delicate, ever-changing balance between all previously separated and altered components.","2012-08","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","156-162","","2","17","","","Depth Modulation","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/HQ6L8SNW/Trębacz - 2012 - Depth Modulation Composing motion in immersive au.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, this is achieved by making use of vibrotactile feedback as a signalling tool within an improvisational setting. A discussion of the current developments regarding the use of networks within improvisation is presented, followed by an outline of the benefits of utilising the haptic feedback channel as a further sensory information pathway when performing digital music. We describe a case study of the system within the context of our computer-mediated improvisational duo Můstek, involving piano, percussion and live electronics. Here, a cueing system or framework is imposed over the improvisation and is transmitted directly to the skin of the performers via tiny vibrations. Additionally, performers may make use of simple vibrotactile signals to enhance traditional visual cues that are often employed within performance. A new work, Socks and Ammo, was created using NeVIS, and was presented at various international conferences and festivals. We also tested the system itself within a group of postgraduate researchers and composers. Qualitative evaluation of the musical outcomes as experienced both by the performers and by the listeners at these events is offered, as well as implications about the nature of collaborative music-making.","2012-02","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","36-44","","1","17","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/42IXGML6/Hayes and Michalakos - 2012 - Imposing a Networked Vibrotactile Communication Sy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article challenges this narrative by drawing attention to the work of filmmakers in the 1930s that foreshadowed the sound experiments of Pierre Schaeffer and thus offers an alternative history of their background. The main focus of the article is on the innovations within documentary film and specifically the sonic explorations in early British documentary that prefigured musique concrète, an area ignored by electronic music studies. The theoretical and philosophical underpinnings of the documentary movement’s members, particularly their leader John Grierson, will be compared with those of Pierre Schaeffer, and the important influence of Russian avant-garde filmmaking on the British (and musique concrète) will be addressed. Case studies will focus on the groundbreaking soundtracks of two films made by the General Post Office Film Unit that feature both practical and theoretical correspondences to Schaeffer: 6.30 Collection (1934) and Coal Face (1935). Parallels between the nature and use of technologies and how this affected creative outputs will also be discussed, as will the relationship of the British documentary movement’s practice and ideas to post-Schaefferian ‘anecdotal music’ and the work of Luc Ferrari.","2017-08","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","172-186","","2","22","","","‘There Must Be a Poetry of Sound That None of Us Knows…’","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/5L9UVCK9/Cox - 2017 - ‘There Must Be a Poetry of Sound That None of Us K.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Informed by the materialism of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, an image of ‘flows of inhomogeneous matter’ provokes reflection on a mode of production common to artisanal craftmanship and digital lutherie alike, namely the pre-reflective skilfulness negotiating the singularities of inhomogeneous matter with the demands of the production – a process which itself may be thought of as im-pro-visation (‘un-fore-seen’). According to Gilbert Simondon, all technical objects develop in this way: functional interdependency emerges when abstractly ideated elements begin to enter into unanticipated synergistic relationships, suggesting a material logic dependent on unforeseen potentialities. The historical development of the acoustic violin exemplifies such an evolution, with, like all technical objects, additional latent potential. Digital artists can work like artisanal craftsmen in tinkering with technical elements, teasing out their synergies through abductive, trial-and-error experimentation. In the context of developing digital musical instruments, model-free design of real-time digital signal processing symmetrising action and perception yields highly refined results. Like musical improvisation – constrained by time – improvised development of these instruments turns the material obstacles into their very means of realisation.","2021-04","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","2023-07-11 06:20:49","65-77","","1","26","","","Flows of Inhomogeneous Matter","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/MDH3CAPU/Thorn - 2021 - Flows of Inhomogeneous Matter Improvising an augm.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article argues that when pushed to the point of failure, playback media begin to function as an improviser, exhibiting musical agency over the performance that mirrors that of human improvisers. This article will identify how failing playback functions within a performance, and explore the ways in which it can be understood to improvise, discussing how failing playback media can engage in a dialogical back and forth with human improvisers as well as the ways it can directly influence and determine the structure and musical content of a performance.","2021-04","2023-07-11 06:21:45","2023-07-11 06:21:45","2023-07-11 06:21:45","110-118","","1","26","","","More Than an Instrument","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/9AASM3AK/Higgins - 2021 - More Than an Instrument Improvising with failing .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The concept of acousmatic storytelling is introduced, illustrated by the example of one of my own works which was created with the elements and techniques of storytelling as its conceptual basis. The article continues to investigate concepts of acousmatic storytelling in works from the repertoire of electroacoustic music, with composers such as Ferrari, Westerkamp, Derbyshire, Cousins and Young providing especially pertinent examples. Acousmatic storytelling integrates interviews, archival recordings, soundscape recordings, sonic icons and music quotations; the microphone becomes a time machine, ‘thought capturer’ and a conduit for conveying cultural information, elements which, combined with the sonic world composed in the studio, create a hybrid form. The concepts introduced in this article are useful for all those working with recorded sound, offering an approach to sonic creativity based on storytelling techniques and the way we experience past events through memory and sound recording. Acousmatic storytelling transmits a unique version of a story to the mind of the listener, who participates in the creation of the story and acts as co-creator of that story as experienced. In applying the methodology of interviews as well as researching past events and ‘writing’ about them, acousmatic storytelling composers can also be seen as historians and journalists.","2016-12","2023-07-11 06:21:45","2023-07-11 06:21:45","2023-07-11 06:21:45","213-221","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/8YFIRNJ7/Amelides - 2016 - Acousmatic Storytelling.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article lends support to this argument by developing an ecosystemically situated account of our relationships with technology and processes of skill formation. It is argued that this sense of continuity is justified, but that where differences of experiences do arise these are not, as sometimes supposed, an essential characteristic of digital technologies. On the basis that much of our skill formation consists of tacit knowledge, it is suggested that further discussion on how particular circumstances and skills arise would be revealing.

From this perspective, Sud may be perceived as an encounter between human imagination and nature in two of its most powerful symbols: the sea, alluded to through the sounds of the waves, and the forest, alluded to through the sounds of birds and insects. The piece presents an exploration of the essence of these environmental sounds, which are either modified or recreated with different substances. In its appeal to images widespread in a variety of cultures, as well as in its unique use of traditional musical materials, Sud is more than a strongly programmatic and visually evocative piece.","1997-08","2023-07-11 06:21:45","2023-07-11 06:21:45","2023-07-11 06:21:45","97-106","","2","2","","","A perceptual approach to the analysis of J.

It is used in educational and compositional contexts as a tool, as well as being an established independent performance practice, albeit for a relatively small body of audience. The discussion is led through three concepts that are utilised by pragmatists, but which resonate with the concerns of free improvisers: experience, expressive object and gesture. Outlining these key ideas, the article sheds light on John Dewey’s and Giovanni Maddalena’s thoughts on aesthetics, which provide a perspective for examining these inherent issues of free improvisation.

Eventually we will discuss a semiotic interpretation of the music analysed. The present paper is a continuation of two previous papers that have presented conceptual and graphic tools for an aural, spectromorphological analysis of music. The first paper, published in Organised Sound 12/2, demonstrated the spectromorphological categories for the transcription of sound objects (level one).

Playing with a system such as the one described in this article, with limited intelligence and no real cognitive skills, will obviously reveal the weaknesses of the system, but it will also convey part of the preconditions and aesthetic frameworks that the human improviser brings to the table. If we want the autonomous system to have the same kind of freedom we commonly value in human players’ improvisational practice, are we prepared to accept that it may develop in a direction that departs from our original aesthetical ambitions? The analyses is based on some of the documented interplay between the musicians in a group in workshops and laboratories. The question of what constitutes an ethical relationship in this kind of improvisation is briefly discussed.

To illustrate, I refer to As I Have Now Memoyre, my 2008 installation-performance on the relationship between music, memory and the passing of time. Accordingly, I investigate the way in which a performer is able to assert her ontological reciprocity with the total performance environment by ‘embodying’ the electronic processing, asserting continuity between the electronically mediated performance and the performance rendered by her own unaided body.","2011-08","2023-07-11 06:21:45","2023-07-11 06:21:45","2023-07-11 06:21:45","176-183","","2","16","","","Being Among the Living","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/94X9ZV68/Brown - 2011 - Being Among the Living On the inter-relations bet.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Turntable teams, such as the Scratch Perverts, the Mixologists and the DMU Crew, do not create their original compositions from within the Western art tradition of an independent artist creating work in isolation, which is then communicated to performers through staff notation. Instead, turntable teams compose and perform as a collective to create original compositions from existing records, and in doing so have developed innovative compositional strategies.To be able to analyse and discuss the creative processes of hip-hop turntable teams it has been necessary to construct my own model framework to enable me to identify similar patterns in the creative processes of the teams discussed. In the article, I discuss and analyse one routine from each of the three teams using this framework, focusing on the emergent process of ‘collective creation’. The article concludes by establishing a number of characteristics of the compositional processes used by UK turntable teams. Until now, scholarship has neglected the music of hip-hop. Previous work on hip-hop music has been concerned with either sociological or cultural and historical aspects. This article offers a new approach to hip-hop scholarship because it focuses on the actual music of turntable teams and the emergent processes that have developed to create it.","2007-04","2023-07-11 06:21:45","2023-07-11 06:21:45","2023-07-11 06:21:45","79-87","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/ZF75QJUS/Smith - 2007 - The process of ‘collective creation’ in the compos.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through a practice-oriented approach, participants gain insights into areas such as the abstract world of digital sound recording and representation, the extreme influence on this content enacted by a given sound delivery system and a given space, and the subjective experience of listening to sounds from a variety of orientations and postures, and with varying levels of understanding of the original source recordings.

The app created a framework for a negotiated language of symbols used by two groups of students at Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 to tell stories through sound and music.

This article suggests that analysis of the mixtape’s history and ethos can provide useful insight into ongoing tensions between cultures of active and passive listening, questions of ownership with regard to recorded sound and between the roles of producer and consumer within contemporary audio culture. It also proposes, via reference to relevant contemporary works, that the mixtape may now be considered a vital hybrid creative form, part composition/part compilation, with which composers, producers and sonic artists may actively engage. It historically and culturally contextualises this form, placing it within a lineage of military, political, creative and commercial conflict, which, among recorded sound technologies, is unique to tape and shows that the mixtape may be seen as an expression or utilisation of these factors. Consistent commercial and industrial efforts to suppress tape’s subversive qualities are outlined as are creative methodologies which have been adopted to resist such efforts. Contemporary music industry strategies to channel and commodify the aura and ethos of the mixtape as forerunner of the curated playlists vital to its current business model are detailed and contemporary cassette culture is considered as an alternative inheritor of the mixtape’s legacy and as alternative model for future musical creation and distribution.

Research into available forms of analysis of speech is discussed below with regard to two specific areas, feature vectors from linear predictive coding (LPC) analysis and hidden Markov-model-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. These are discussed in order to demonstrate that whilst aspects of each may be useful in devising a system of speech-archive manipulation for artistic use. Their drawbacks and deficiencies for use in art – consequent of the reasons for their invention – necessitate the creation of tools with artistic, rather than engineering agendas in mind.It is through the initial process of devising conceptual tools for understanding speech as sound objects that I have been confronted with issues of semiotics and semantics of the voice and of the relationship between sound and meaning in speech, and of the role of analysis in mediating existing methods of communication. This is discussed with reference to Jean-Jacques Nattiez's Music and Discourse: Towards a Semiology of Music (Nattiez 1987). The ‘trace’ – a neutral level of semiotic analysis proposed by Nattiez, far from being hypothetical as suggested by Hatten (1992: 88–98) and others, is present by analogy to many forms of mediation in modern spoken communication and the reproduction of music, and it is precisely this neutrality with regards to meaning that tools for manipulation of speech must possess, since the relationships between the sound of speech and its meaning are ‘intense’ (after Deleuze 1968).","2006-04","2023-07-11 06:23:22","2023-07-11 06:23:22","2023-07-11 06:23:22","73-80","","1","11","","","Deconstructing Speech","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/VXSNVPKL/Kelly - 2006 - Deconstructing Speech new tools for speech manipu.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Following Pierre Schaeffer's first experiments in Paris, many composers became interested in the expressive resources of the mechanical voice, the results of which are now present in a large corpus of electroacoustic works. By its very nature, artificial vocality establishes a new link between the vocal quality of a sound event (its vocality) and technology (its artificiality) within this type of music.How then, can the musicologist study artificial vocality and the works in which it is used? Which tools should be used? What makes the analysis of artificial vocality so specific? Is it possible to create new tools for the analysis of artificial vocality within electroacoustic music?In the search for answers to these questions, many difficulties present themselves. The first concerns the modes of representation and the methods used to analyse artificial vocality. On top of this, real reflection is needed concerning the disparity of technological tools used in analysis and the need for the application of a certain methodology in order to classify them. The starting point will be the establishment of a typology. Finally, the idea of being able to compare different representations of the same work using sophisticated tools will open the way to the discovery of new analytical approaches. Seeking freedom from the relative blindness caused by the over-specialisation and rigidity of technological tools is now an urgent necessity, particularly when considering artificial vocality.","2004-04","2023-07-11 06:23:22","2023-07-11 06:23:22","2023-07-11 06:23:22","91-98","","1","9","","","Reflections on the analysis of artificial vocality","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/6BG7W2A3/Bossis - 2004 - Reflections on the analysis of artificial vocality.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since statics was designed by a composer with musical goals in mind, the program is itself is a collection of compositional decisions. Furthermore, the unique timbres and structures created by statics are a direct result of these decisions. Accordingly, I discuss my compositional process in two stages: those choices that are embedded into the program (general decisions) and those choices that occurred post-design (specific decisions).

After reviewing the technological differences of the two aesthetics of musique concrète (France) and elektronische Musik (Germany), it is possible to see how Stockhausen transcended this distinction by gradually creating more diversified material, leading to a ‘world material’, independent from the tools used. This comes along with a more global approach to the sound. The composer, by an appropriate use of the equipment, does not seek an individual control of each element or each parameter, but has a larger-scale view, in which time units are longer and are considered as a whole. This conception, while remaining as precise as an analytical approach, involves a rethinking of the time development, proposed by Stockhausen as the Momentform, a new musical form in which each part is independent and does not constitute the continuation of the preceding one. This reflection on non-linearity in a work, and on relative perception of time, is a key to understanding Stockhausen's music.","2008-12","2023-07-11 06:23:22","2023-07-11 06:23:22","2023-07-11 06:23:23","167-175","","3","13","","","The First Electroacoustic Pieces by Karlheinz Stockhausen","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/25DDZ9KY/Tissot - 2008 - The First Electroacoustic Pieces by Karlheinz Stoc.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It continues with a similar questioning of the usual interpretation of analysis by examining the variety of aims, methods, and characteristics of analytical methods, and encourages an increased awareness on the part of all analysts to appreciate where their own work is situated within the field. Typical concerns of electroacoustics, such as the design of timbral structures, gestures and textures are discussed within the realm of parametric analysis, but allusion is also made to other approaches which examine style and context. Disciplines from perception to semiotics are shown to have relevance for further development of adequate analytical tools. The author does not advocate one particular approach, but rather attempts to demonstrate the vastness and intricacy of the field.

While Modalys-ER provides users with a relatively simple-to-use interface, it has only limited methods for mapping control data onto model parameters for performance. While these are sufficient for many interesting applications, they do not bridge the gap from high-level specifications such as MIDI files or Standard Western Notation (SWN) down to low-level parameters within the physical model. With this issue in mind, a part of Modalys-ER has now been ported to OpenMusic, providing a platform for developing more sophisticated automation and control systems that can be specified through OpenMusic's visual programming interface.

It starts with various definitions employed and the ways that recent museum exhibitions have left the genre’s parameters seemingly open-ended, as well as the problems to be faced in finding a ‘frame’ for sound in an exhibition setting. The article then lays out the roots of the form’s aesthetics, including the disjunction between sound and image afforded by the invention of recording, musique concrète, and spatialised composition through the centuries. Sound art’s relationships to the 60s art movement Earthworks, ambient music, sound by visual artists, architecture, sound sculpture, surveillance, sound design and sound ecology are explored to contextualise its significance not only to different disciplines within the arts to but sound’s place in contemporary society. At the conclusion, two recent works by D.A.M.A.G.E. and David Byrne, which loom somewhere in-between music and sound art, are considered in light of the increasingly fluid interpretation of sound art’s identity.","2009-04","2023-07-11 06:23:22","2023-07-11 06:23:22","2023-07-11 06:23:23","3-10","","1","14","","","Sound Art","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/P7R8FPJW/Licht - 2009 - Sound Art Origins, development and ambiguities.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are parts of the world where the practice is virtually unknown; in other places it is the norm and appropriate facilities would be provided as a matter of course for any visiting composer or performer. These ‘local variations’ are not merely ripples on the surface of a standardised performance practice but stem from underlying attitudes to what composition and performance in this medium are about and, ultimately, to a definition of music itself. What follows summarises observations drawn from fifteen years of working with the BEAST concert diffusion system in numerous performance spaces in the UK and Europe, as well as experiencing, both as listener and performer, other systems in Europe and North America.

Some seek to join inherited traditions from within their own ancestral cultures with new traditions from the West or with new technologies. Some are Westerners exploring traditional musical forms and aesthetics from cultures different from their own. The process of engaging interculturally raises complex issues, at times challenging historical attitudes towards the culture of ‘the other’. The author considers a wide range of motivations for this emerging body of work, surveying the range of approaches that composers have taken, and urges the cultivation of cultural sensitivity.

Considering the similarities in methodological approaches between the fields of ethnography and soundscape composition, this paper proposes to further the use of contextual information when making compositional decisions with sound materials derived from field recordings: a socio-sonic methodology. To begin the discussion, theoretical readings of sound in context are presented. Parallels are highlighted between the practices of ethnographic study and soundscape composition, illustrated with the work of Steve Feld and the World Soundscape Project. A brief consideration of the soundscape–acousmatic continuum with reference to works by Luc Ferrari, Denis Smalley and Hildegard Westerkamp is followed by a combined summation of ethnographic, soundscape and acousmatic approaches to outline a socio-sonic methodology for composition. Examples of work by Peter Cusack, Justin Bennett and Bob Ostertag are discussed alongside my own work Manifest – a fixed-media composition based on field recordings and interviews made at political protests in Barcelona.

Timbre is understood as dependent on both spectral and time-dependent features that can be notated in ways that make sense in relation to both perception and acoustics. This is achieved by taking the starting point in Lasse Thoresen’s spectromorphological analysis. Symbols originally developed for perception-based analysis are adapted for use over a hybrid spectrum-staff system to indicate the spectral qualities of timbre. To test the system, it was used to transcribe excerpts of three classic electroacoustic music works. In addition to the benefit of being able to compare the three excerpts transcribed with the same system, there is the advantage that the visual representation is based on spectral measurable qualities in the music. The notation system’s intuitiveness was also explored in listening tests, showing that it was possible to understand spectral notation symbols placed over a staff system, particularly for examples with two sound objects instead of one.","2022-12","2023-07-11 06:23:22","2023-07-11 06:23:22","2023-07-11 06:23:23","387-400","","3","27","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/AJILTQLW/Sköld - 2022 - The Visual Representation of Timbre.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I believe that the aesthetic experience is central to a more ecological positioning of the human being on earth and that aesthetic experience should involve a ‘rewilding of the ear’. To discuss this concept, I build an argument from Edgard Varèse’s music as ‘organised sound’ and approach it from a perceptual point of view. This leads to the discussion of other concepts, such as David Dunn’s ‘grief of incommunicability’ (Dunn 1997) and Jean-François Augoyard and Henry Torgue’s ‘sharawadgi effect’ (Bick 2008). Further to this I discuss parallels between Truax’s continuum (Speech–Music–Soundscape) and Peirce’s semiotic system. Taking points from these theories, we can discuss the possibility of the re-tuning of our ears to the wider sound palette of the world. I consider George Monbiot’s concepts of ‘rewilding’ and ‘rewilding of the human life’ (Monbiot 2014), in order to create a parallel to our relationship with the soundscape.","2017-04","2023-07-11 06:23:22","2023-07-11 06:23:22","2023-07-11 06:23:23","51-60","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/EX2J9VSA/Pinto - 2017 - Towards a Rewilding of the Ear.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Placement of sensors and the design of its digital signal processing build upon the physical characteristics, and expand upon the acoustical features, of this traditional instrument. Its design facilitates the integration of real-time recorded, as well as pre-recorded sounds, into an unfolding montage of sound. The system is discussed from both a technical point of view and from the perspective of a Western electronic musician addressing a non-Western acoustical instrument. Relevant questions about cross-cultural borrowing and the impact of electronics on the sounds and performance technique of a traditional instrument are discussed. The author addresses the role played by his Jewish identification, as a member of an ethno-religious group with a historical connection to Ottomon musical traditions, on the choices involved.

Building upon the Intention/Reception project of Leigh Landy (2006) and Rob Weale (2005), the project sought to investigate audience interpretations for works of electroacoustic audiovisual music and to utilise an expanded understanding of the audience – as active participants in interpretation – to subsequently inform the composition of new works. This project combined three distinct research methodologies: empirical data collection, scholarly research and composition. The composed works were both informed by the results of empirical data collection and scholarly research, and adapted (re-composed) throughout the latter stages of the research in order to explore emergent research findings and research hypotheses.Interpretations were demonstrated to be contingent upon the individual lived experience of an audience member, with aspects of the work's discourse acting to narrow the interpretative potential of the work. The use of mimetic materials (sonic or visual) within works of electroacoustic audiovisual music were demonstrated to be potentially obstructing to an aesthetic interpretation of the work.

One of the issues that arose out of these pieces was the question of location of the ‘voice’. It is as if a state of limbo is created between the narrative voice of the text and the implied voice of the music, due to the absence of a conventional focal point to pin it on – an actor or a singer. I would like to suggest that because of this vacancy and the way the projected word takes the place of the sung or spoken voice, the inner voice of the audience becomes activated.

Suzanne Guerlac points to Bergson’s theory of real duration (durée réelle) that is the vital energy of animate experience and consciousness as opposed to the entropic energy (thermodynamic) of physics.

As used against the Branch Davidian religious sect in 1993 at Waco Texas, the FBI’s little remembered ‘sonic assault’ – involving Tibetan monks in prayer, dentist drills, and other bizarre recordings – arguably contributed to the tragic denouement of events as they were witnessed live on TV by millions around the world. The use of sustained, high-pitched, loud or repetitive noises and music added to an already incendiary narrative endgame, established first by the sect but later supported by the media. This essay draws on this tragic event, and later ‘forensic’ research conducted by the author in the process of writing, scoring and producing an audio performance work, Cantata of Fire. Specifically, it explores the way in which amplified ‘concrete’ sound and electronic ‘viral’ voices were used as a weapon at Waco – materially, psychologically, theatrically and ‘diegetically’. And in the context of a much longer (and repressed) history of sound as used in ‘theatres of war’ and other conflicts, the author reconsiders the overlooked and underestimated powers of sound, music and noise in an age dominated by digital ‘real-time’ electronic media and ‘tele-visual’ surveillance.","2009-04","2023-07-11 06:25:40","2023-07-11 06:25:40","2023-07-11 06:25:40","89-99","","1","14","","","Cantata of Fire","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/PBM2ACKT/Madsen - 2009 - Cantata of Fire Son et lumière in Waco Texas, aus.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on the experience gained from two linked research projects – one looking at the development of the practice, the other seeking to archive it – it is suggested that the two apparently disparate areas of activity can be fruitfully regarded as overlapping in many respects. Both activities involve selection and aesthetic judgement, both strive for an elusive ‘completeness’ while acknowledging its impossibility, and at a technical level the strategies now emerging for searching and collating information from ‘separate’ archives look increasingly like the strategies used in some areas of ‘real-time’ composition and performance practice. It is argued that archivists of material from such a disparate and rapidly developing practice, rather than aiming for spurious ‘coverage’ of the field, should acknowledge and celebrate their difference from each other, while conforming to simple principles which will allow their archived content to be searched and collated dynamically by individual users, each querying and configuring the material optimally for their own purposes.","2006-08","2023-07-11 06:25:40","2023-07-11 06:25:40","2023-07-11 06:25:40","143-147","","2","11","","","Making the Archive and Archiving the Making","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/7IAXLFZ9/Waters - 2006 - Making the Archive and Archiving the Making insig.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a technological sound art practice, EcoSono uses technology to link human and environmental expression, in an attempt to define a collaborative and symbiotic relationship between humans and the natural world. At the core of this work are computational and transduction technologies enabling deeper human–environment interaction. This paper describes three projects including the MICE (Mobile Interactive Computer Ensemble) World Tour, the EcoSono Institute music/science collaboration adventure, and the Agents Against Agency series in emergent and improvised musical forms. The article also addresses several key values of interactive ecoacoustics. First, it describes the importance of ‘impracticality’ in creating a productive environmentalist art work.

The Reeds project was commissioned by the Melbourne International Festival of the Arts in 2000, and first exhibited in November and December of that year on the Ornamental Lake at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne. It consists of twenty-one large floating sculptures, modelled to represent clusters of river reeds in immaculate man-made plantings. Each reed pod contains a collection of electronics for either the gathering of weather information or the reception and dispersion of sound. The sound installation gathered data from two real-time weather stations, and produced eight channels of musical output by interpreting the machine unit pulses of the weather data as pulse inputs to Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) algorithms. The Reeds project focused on a consideration of multiple streams of chaotic and constantly varying sound. I was interested in exploring whether the sonic environment would remain homogenous even though, unlike a musical ensemble, the control inputs varied randomly and independently of each other. The sound installation was site specific, reflecting directly upon the environment it inhabited, both in terms of its visual quality, and aesthetic of the sound.","2003-08","2023-07-11 06:25:40","2023-07-11 06:25:40","2023-07-11 06:25:40","139-149","","2","8","","","Reeds","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/8NKFN5TX/Paine - 2003 - Reeds a responsive environmental sound installati.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two issues in particular are considered: compositional (especially mimesis and the construction of image, and what shall be termed ‘ephemeral narrative’) and presentational (in particular multichannel speaker deployment). While exploring several relevant works within this discussion, by way of a case study the article introduces the author’s GRIDs project – a series of four multichannel sound sculptures united in their arrangement in geometric arrays of many (in some cases potentially hundreds of) loudspeakers. These permit, by virtue of being so massively (and geometrically) multichannel, the generation of extremely intricate spatial sound environments – fabricated landscapes – that emerge directly from an acousmatic compositional aesthetic. Owing to their alternative means of presentation and presentation contexts, however, they offer very different experiences from those of acousmatic music encountered in the concert hall. So the latter part of this article explores the various ways in which the listener might engage with constructed image space within these sound sculptures, along with the relationship of the audio content of each with its visual and situational setup – that is, its environment.","2015-08","2023-07-11 06:25:40","2023-07-11 06:25:40","2023-07-11 06:25:40","148-159","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/H8CY665F/Batchelor - 2015 - Acousmatic Approaches to the Construction of Image.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In that article, I explored how electroacoustic music artists manage to integrate multiple cultural frameworks, while also acknowledging the importance of personal artistic agency. The primary question that emerged from that research is extended in this article: how does an electroacoustic performer of a non-Western instrument improvise outside the idiom of their tradition? In order to address this question, I draw on Tomlinson’s concept of the metaphysical imaginary. In my own performance practice, I employ the metaphysical imaginary as a framework to explore a transcultural, transcendent, perhaps even spiritual potential of electroacoustic improvisation. The metaphysical imaginary will be explored in two dimensions: the synchronic and the diachronic. The synchronic dimension looks horizontally across cultures, while the diachronic dimension looks in a temporal verticality, looking inwards and downwards, to a time before modern culture. In the article, I discuss the performance practice of other musicians working across different cultural frames who explore the metaphysical in their improvisations. The article also looks backwards in cultural historical time and investigates how improvisers draw inspiration from a pre-modern cultural world, combining these imaginaries with modern sound techniques. I will situate my own work within this mosaic of practices, concluding with a discussion of electroacoustic improvisations using the sarode, extended technique and the re-imagining of pre-historic sonic rituals.","2022-08","2023-07-11 06:28:20","2023-07-11 06:28:20","2023-07-11 06:28:20","172-181","","2","27","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/VSTYAK9Z/Noone - 2022 - Electroacoustic Improvisation and the Metaphysical.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It does this by studying the history of mechanical musical instruments and kinetic art, the role of immateriality in the history of Western art, and the renewed focus on materiality in the arts. Materiality is key to understanding the resurgence of kinetics in sound art. The first part of this article studies the historical narratives of materiality in sound art, while the second part investigates materiality in my own works as more contemporary examples. Here the text turns to exploration of the material and acoustic properties of metal rods and plates, and suggests that direct contact with sound-producing objects provides opportunities for new art forms where the morphology of sound can be developed in dialogue with the physical objects and the surrounding space. By examining the underlying acoustic principles of rods and plates, we get a deeper understanding of the relationship between mathematical models and the actual sounding objects. Using the acoustic model with basic input parameters enables us to explore the timbral possibilities of the sound objects. This allows us to shape the spectrum of acoustic sound objects with great attention to detail, and makes models from spectromorphology relevant during the construction of the objects. The physical production of sound objects becomes both spectral composition and shaping of spatial objects. This highlights the importance of knowledge of both materials and acoustic principles, and questions the traditional perception of sound art and music as immaterial art forms.","2018-12","2023-07-11 06:28:20","2023-07-11 06:28:20","2023-07-11 06:28:20","225-234","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/MZKTWZJF/Flø - 2018 - Materiality in Sound Art.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the fifty years of the GRM cannot be dissociated from the preceding period, datable from 1942, when Pierre Schaeffer began experiments with radiophonic sound which led him to musique concrète while bringing into existence the institutional infrastructure of the group. We can therefore see the Studio d'Essai (1942–46), the Club d'Essai (1946–60) with its Groupe de Recherche de Musique Concrète (GRMC, 1951–58) as forebears of the GRM. The fundamental principle, which lies in working with sonic material directly on the recording media through a precise listening to recorded elements, led Schaeffer to affirm that there is another way to access music other than from notation.He used this powerful idea as the fixed point on the compass for all his research. Linked from its origins to the broadcasting services – RTF until 1964, ORTF up to 1974, then INA ever since – the GRM has constantly adapted its theories and its ideas to successive technological developments: smooth disks (shellac records), magnetic tape, computer memory.

I argue for a conception of sound as a continuous, anonymous flux to which human expressions contribute but which precedes and exceeds these expressions. Developing Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz’s conception of the perceptual unconscious, I propose that this sonic flux is composed of two dimensions: a virtual dimension that I term ‘noise’ and an actual dimension that consists of contractions of this virtual continuum: for example, music and speech. Examining work by Max Neuhaus, Chris Kubick, Francisco Lopez and others, I suggest that the richest works of sound art help to disclose the virtual dimension of sound and its process of actualisation.","2009-04","2023-07-11 06:30:12","2023-07-11 06:30:12","2023-07-11 06:30:12","19-26","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/QX4Y3GNS/Cox - 2009 - Sound Art and the Sonic Unconscious.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Often it is also necessary to be able to navigate between certain parameter configurations in an easy and intuitive way, rather than to precisely define the evolution of the values for each parameter. Graphical interpolation systems (GIS) provide this level of control by allocating objects within a visual control space to sets of parameters that are to be controlled, and using a moving cursor to change the parameter values according to its current position within the control space.

A peculiarity of the mixed-work experience is that only some of the sound sources are seen, while many others may be heard. Consequently, a perceptual dissonance often arises between visual and aural stimuli, drawing particular attention to the relationship between the live and non-live components. Such a heightened perceptual focus on relations suggests the need for an analytical framework and terminology. This paper proposes a multidimensional framework of relations between live and non-live component pairs in mixed works, which can both serve as a model and foundation for analysis as well as provide composers with pathways of relations available under certain conditions.","2010-08","2023-07-11 06:30:12","2023-07-11 06:30:12","2023-07-11 06:30:13","96-106","","2","15","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/DQ9R6ZIW/Frengel - 2010 - A Multidimensional Approach to Relationships betwe.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

John Cage is well known for use of chance methods as an organising principle in his works from the early 1950s onward, based on a professed desire to reflect ‘nature’ in art. Cage’s close colleague David Tudor presents a quite different relationship to the ‘natural’ in his live-electronic music, showing distinctly non-Cageian uses of chance means. Alvin Lucier, whose interaction with Cage and Tudor as a young ‘experimental’ composer was important, frequently describes his work as having a close connection to the ‘natural’, but shows a third quite different way of allowing this relationship to inform his work.","2010-08","2023-07-11 06:30:12","2023-07-11 06:30:12","2023-07-11 06:30:13","133-136","","2","15","","","‘Nature’ as an Organising Principle","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/A6BF2YPX/Rogalsky - 2010 - ‘Nature’ as an Organising Principle Approaches to.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Central to the paper is an understanding of ‘interaction’ as a network of interdependencies among system components, and as a means for dynamical behaviour to emerge upon the contact of an autonomous system (e.g. a DSP unit) with the external environment (room or else hosting the performance). The author describes the design philosophy in his current work with the AESI (whose DSP component was implemented as a signal patch in KYMA5.2), touching on compositional implications (not only live electronics situations, but also sound installations).","2003-12","2023-07-11 06:30:12","2023-07-11 06:30:12","2023-07-11 06:30:13","269-277","","3","8","","","‘Sound is the interface’","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/4TML4VL4/Scipio - 2003 - ‘Sound is the interface’ from interactive to ecos.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analytical methodology focuses on pitch, rhythm, and timbre equally, using both standard music notation and spectral analysis to examine the contrapuntal elements in this classic electroacoustic composition.

Sets of expectations and personal identities inform listening experiences, in addition to the material-orientated tendencies in the field, deriving from soundscape composition and acousmatic music. Specific sociopolitical examples that inform sonic experiences in diverse listening situations across different geographic regions are used to uncover bias, and some of the preconceptions of listeners.

The theory advocates loudspeakers as the mediators of the experience and the stage as part of the audience’s assembly.

Findings from sightreading studies exploring the manner in which notation is encoded, processed and executed are examined with the aim of identifying the perceptual and practical boundaries of presenting animated notation on screen. The development of efficient visual representation is proposed as an important requirement for alleviating the issues created by the time constraints of reading on screen.

This article, along with the composition it frames, thinks through a vision of environmental sound art that completes a link between sonic practice and its object. As a project, it navigates human/animal difference through a sonic knowing which is founded on life’s shared constitution in signs. Sounds beyond spoken words, like the signs that dominate non-human life, are foundationally non-symbolic, and the ability of environmental sound art to resemble and evoke networks of icons and indices is in some respects a privileged position of electroacoustic music. The article presents a non-dualistic sonic thinking within the decentred perspective of the environment, which emerges as a plural product of its engagements and participants. A vision for soundscape composition is presented, along with a frame for its interpretation as sonic thought, or phonosophy.","2020-12","2023-07-11 06:31:17","2023-07-11 06:31:17","2023-07-11 06:31:17","321-326","","3","25","","","Swamp, Sound, Sign","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/YLRUSXSS/Bertrand - 2020 - Swamp, Sound, Sign Reflections on interspecies di.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Electronic sound becomes regarded as embedded on a reservoir of qualities, memories and registers of technologies that inhabit our sound environment.From this starting point our apprehension of technologically produced sound is reassessed, constituted as the crossing of particular conditions of production and reception, cultural traces and codes inherent in the practices and characteristics of media.This perspective lays the ground for a compositional approach that exposes and problematises the interaction of these multiple conditions.","2013-12","2023-07-11 06:31:17","2023-07-11 06:31:17","2023-07-11 06:31:17","306-313","","3","18","","","Tactility, Traces and Codes","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/AFKPKDWD/Paiuk - 2013 - Tactility, Traces and Codes Reassessing timbre in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With our collective imaginations, it should be possible to preserve many of these aspects by transforming them, with sensitivity, to fit new contexts.

I argue that our understanding of audiovisual status needs to be expanded beyond the scope of screen-based applications and move into the physical realm of objects and material. Further to this, I outline how the dominant discussions around materiality in sound-based art do not speak sufficiently to the physical materiality manifested in a growing wave within the field.

Reception-based investigations (such as Weale 2005) seem either at a relatively early stage or understandably inconclusive, with an emphasis on how the listener accesses, or might access, the work. While this might appear a semantic nicety, I suggest that it could be fruitful to proceed instead from considerations of how the work might ‘access’ the listener, via considering diverse experience, rather than direct associative responses to sound, as material that is organised in both creating and listening to sound-based work – and by whom left open to negotiation.","2010-08","2023-07-11 06:31:17","2023-07-11 06:31:17","2023-07-11 06:31:17","116-124","","2","15","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/8BI44YRN/Norman - 2010 - Conkers (listening out for organised experience).pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four cable and servomotor systems allow for four degrees of freedom, including the lateral motion of a bow stroke across a string, the rotational motion of a bow crossing strings, the vertical motion of a bow approaching and pushing into a string, and the longitudinal motion of a bow travelling along the length of a string. Encoders, attached to the shaft of the servomotors, sense the gesture of the performer, through the rotation of the servomotor shafts, turned by the motion of the cables. The data from each encoder is mapped to a parameter in synthesis software of a bowed-string physical model.

A wide variety of sounds such as plucked, hit, bowed and scraped sounds can be produced, all having natural physical and spacial qualities. Some of the musical and philosophical issues considered to be most important during the design and development of the system are touched upon, and the main features of the system are explained with reference to practical examples.

In the design of modified string instruments which mimic features of natural acoustic predecessors, new technology is applied on many levels. A taxonomy is proposed for the past, present and future of instrument design. Due consideration is given to the music which results from the new sound world, especially that involving interactive electronic processing.

However, due to its newness and flexibility, potential users have found it very hard to explore its possibilities as there is no clear referential framework to hold on to when designing sounds. Standard software synthesis systems take this framework for granted by adopting a taxonomy for synthesis instruments that has been inherited from the acoustic musical instruments tradition, i.e. woodwind, brass, string, percussion, etc. Sadly, the most interesting synthesised sounds that these systems can produce are simply referred to as effects. This scheme clearly does not meet the demands of more innovative software synthesizers. In order to alleviate this problem, we propose an alternative taxonomy for Chaosynth timbres.

In the article the various positions are unfolded through discussions within the theoretical field of media archaeology – a science with its roots in media studies, but also an important framework for the production and understanding of a variety of DIY practices.The overall purpose with the article is twofold: on the one hand it illustrates how theories from the field of media archaeology contribute interesting perspectives to discussions of artistic work within the area of DIY.

Employing a range of diverse technical tools and aesthetic ideas, both works convey, powerfully and dynamically, a sense of deeply invested listening. I approach the discussion of specific compositional processes and musical outcomes in these two works through an investigation of Lockwood's and White's firsthand experiences as both listeners and composers. Centring on the exchange between sensing body and thinking mind, my research here engages with the arc of the creative process as an experience permeated by spaces of perception, reflection, imagination and action.","2011-12","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","211-219","","3","16","","","Listen Compose Listen","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/2UYZLLH4/Nagai - 2011 - Listen Compose Listen A study of perception, proc.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time there is a large body of research regarding gesture in performance that is concerned with the expressive and communicative nature of musical performance. While these views are certainly central to a conceptual understanding of ‘instrument’, it can be limiting to consider them a priori as the only proper model, and to mediate one’s conception of digital instrument design by fixed notions of control, mapping and gesture. As an example of an alternative way to view instrumental response, control structuring and mapping design, this paper discusses the concept of gesture from the point of view of the perception of human intentionality in sound and how one might consider this in interaction design.","2009-08","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","177-187","","2","14","","","Instrumental Listening","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/43KDG7E9/Nort - 2009 - Instrumental Listening sonic gesture as design pr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ideas have interesting implications for the construction of organised sound. We argue that our ecological and statistical experience of sounds in our natural (and man-made) environment is in several respects critical for our choices as soundsmiths and our impressions as listeners. Sonic repetition, both sensory and imag(in)ed, contributes to that environment. Input sounds may be ‘coupled’ to output sounds; and in some cases the physical processes generating sound and the cognitive processes of receiving them are joined. As music technologists we may think of the computer, our sonic vehicle, as a joined bodily sonic-prosthesis. ‘Simple’ sonic ideas may associate with each other through shared biological bases, and become tools for creation of ‘complex’ ideas, as Locke cogitates. Furthermore, we now have new routes towards such complex sounds, including our computer prostheses.","2007-04","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","89-95","","1","12","","","‘Human understanding’ in imagining and organising sound","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/23MTEVYK/Dean and Bailes - 2007 - ‘Human understanding’ in imagining and organising .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper examines the significance of this change and assesses its effects on the productivity and creativity of electroacoustic musicians. More profoundly, it also considers whether this shift in social geography had any bearing on the constitution of an explicit electroacoustic community.To specifically carry out this analysis we consider how an understanding of the system of social relations as a non-random network changes our perception of proximity and distance. We then derive a typology for the contemporary critiques of new technologies and highlight the opportunities it offers to interpret social relations anew. This analysis helps firm up the notion of virtuality that we use to explore our understanding of electroacoustic musical creation with respect to the benefits it can derive from a ‘glocal’ environment. It also establishes the premise of a collective subject emerging from ‘glocal’ communications that may serve as a seed to a renewed electroacoustic community.","2008-08","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","97-102","","2","13","","","Oases","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/NHTPVVMT/Richard - 2008 - Oases From Samarkand to Chang'an to ... now.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the years advance so the opportunities for evaluating the pioneering years of the medium become increasingly remote. Few can now claim first-hand experience of working with the technologies that shaped and influenced the evolution of the early repertory, and many commentators are content to see them consigned to the museum. Others are less sure, having become aware of a number of features that appear to have no parallels in the modern all-digital domain. This article is predicated on the proposition that the functional characteristics of the equipment available during the formative years materially influenced the ways in which composers developed their compositional aesthetic. By studying the characteristics of the resulting interactions, important clues emerge as to the true nature of this engagement. Central to this study is the nature of the techné involved in these processes of creativity, and the significance of this is evaluated in the context of establishing a case for further research in this area. Particular attention is paid to the role of the tape recorder in this context, in particular its influence on the development of spatialisation techniques.","2006-04","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","81-90","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/9KTZ7I5Q/Manning - 2006 - The significance of techné in understanding the ar.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The subject matter of Lonh is desire and romantic pleasures, anchored to feminine subjectivity, represented on stage by a soprano singer. Electronics provide the environmental sounds and amplify the singer's voice. Through Lonh looms a medieval song in the Occitan language, ‘Lanquan li jorn son lonc en mai’ by Jaufré Rudel, a famous troubadour in twelfth-century Provence. Saariaho reverses the narrative convention of love stories by presenting the most intimate encounter at the very beginning. In their succeeding encounters, the lovers move further away from each other. Similarly, in the course of Lonh the distance to Jaufré's song also increases. Luce Irigaray's concepts of love are used for an analysis of the relationship of the loving pair. By the end of Lonh the borderlines of speaking, singing, electronics, language and music collapse in Barthesian jouissance (bliss). The electronic technology in Lonh enables the re-investiture of cultural values, and the construction of flexible identities, crossing boundaries between the self and the other.","2003-04","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","71-84","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/87CG54R3/Sivuoja-Gunaratnam - 2003 - Desire and distance in Kaija Saariaho's Lonh.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We define three layers in the mapping chain: from gesture data to gesture perceptual space, from sound perceptual space to synthesis model parameters, and between the two perceptual spaces. This approach makes the implementation highly modular. Both perceptual spaces are developed and depicted with their features. To get a simple mapping between the gesture perceptual subspace and the sound perceptual subspace, we need to focus our attention on the two other mappings. We explain the mapping types: explicit/implicit, static/dynamic. We also present the technical and aesthetical limits introduced by mapping. Some practical examples are given of the use of perceptual spaces in experiments done at LMA in a musical context. Finally, we discuss several implications of the mapping strategies: the influence of chosen mapping limits onto performers' virtuosity, and the incidence of mapping on the learning process with virtual instruments and on improvisation possibilities.","2002-08","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","127-144","","2","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/7GS86ASV/Arfib et al. - 2002 - Strategies of mapping between gesture data and syn.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Openness to the voice(s) of one’s sonic surroundings is maintained as a hallmark of soundscape works, and also a key component of sound art more generally. Different perspectives and questions are articulated, with a consistent focus on the variety of spaces engaged by both sound(scape) artists and listeners. A case study is presented – a recently initiated sound art project on the part of the author entitled The Icebreaker. The latter is a musical instrument, performance piece and interactive installation made from piezo microphones and ice. Prepared compositions, including soundscape works, are diffused at different moments when one ‘plays’ The Icebreaker. I describe this emergent work as an example of the sort of considerations and negotiations that are at the heart of soundscape/sound art composition.

Originally intended as an explanation of plant phyllotaxis (the structure and arrangement of leaves in plants), reaction–diffusion now forms the basis of an area in biology which is as important as DNA research in the field of biological morphogenesis (Kauffman 1993). Reaction–diffusion systems were successfully utilised within the fields of computer animation and computer graphics to generate visually naturalistic patterning and textures such as animal furs (Turk 1991). More recently, reaction–diffusion systems have been applied to methods of half-tone printing, fingerprint enhancement, and have been proposed for use in sound synthesis (Sherstinsky 1994). The recent publication The Algorithmic Beauty of Seashells (Meinhardt 1995) uses various reaction–diffusion equations to explain patterned pigmentation markings on seashells. This article details an example of the application of reaction–diffusion systems to algorithmic composition within the field of computer music. The patterned data produced by reaction–diffusion systems is used to create a naturalistic soundscape in the piece cicada.","1996-12","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","195-201","","3","1","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/HJSWTGZI/Martin - 1996 - Reaction–diffusion systems for algorithmic composi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In section 2 we discuss issues raised by the application of the ecological approach to composition. Regarding the data-gathering procedures, eco-composition provides two effective methods: re-enaction and anchoring. Organisation of sonic materials is done through accumulation of heterarchical layers, giving rise to emergent musical phenomena. Section 3 dwells on the compositional strategies applied in the multimedia installation Vivir sin después. We describe the process of re-enacting the first Spanish trip through the Amazon River Basin, carried out by Francisco de Orellana and fifty-nine Spaniards in 1541. Then we address technical aspects of the piece, such as the application of multiple views of single entities, the development of non-hierarchical forms and the manipulation of sonic fields.","2006-04","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","55-62","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/GD34FCB3/Keller and Capasso - 2006 - New concepts and techniques in eco-composition.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sonic results were streamed to the Internet, together with images from the exterior of the installation. The installation was located at the central train station in an area where thousands of people pass through every day. The curatorial idea was developed by two institutions, as an answer to their missions of providing interesting sonic material and events for the whole country. The idea was given concrete form by three composers, and brought up on a national level through co-arrangement with a large festival of contemporary music. Funding for the installation was provided by both private and public organisations.

The unfolding of this question is aided by analysis of the control domains of two existing instrument categories, acoustic instruments and digital controllers. Design criteria for making tele-media instruments are formulated thence, and also from consideration of the special capacity of tele-media to bring together multi-lateral non-proximate control sources. Such design anticipates musicians in different continents participating in single sonic outcomes. What does it mean for such a tele-instrument to facilitate virtuosic performance? Any high standard of instrument making urges that instrument makers do so. Virtuosity is understood in part as performance presence, an important issue for tele-media criticism. The broader topic concerning the relation between presence and transmission is represented narrowly here in a single argument. Transmission of performance intention is more important to remote performance presence than literal representations of musicians on stage. Performance presence is better facilitated by interactive graphic notations that dynamically render control domain data into images.

We concentrate on the particular use of sound in this repertoire whose delimitation is still increasing among practitioners. As a relatively new art genre it oscillates between aesthetical and organisational strategies that are commonly found in the domain of both music and visual arts. At the same time, it resists being fully incorporated by these two domains as it develops a discourse that is very specific to its own. To analyse these relations we focus on two fundamental aspects for the study of sound art: space and time. The sound art repertoire approaches these two aspects in a very particular way, placing them at the core of its creative process and establishing connections with conceptual and referential aspects that are put in evidence by sound. We will concentrate on two different points of view: on one side, we analyse how sounds can build temporal discourses that become attached to specific spaces; on the other side, we consider the use of a space that emerges from contextual connections triggered by sounds.","2009-04","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","27-37","","1","14","","","A Metamorphosis of the Muses","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/Z87RPKZP/Campesato - 2009 - A Metamorphosis of the Muses Referential and cont.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I argue that the 1920s–1930s was a period of significance for sound-based arts, and compare it to analogous defining moments in cinema and art photography. After examining the legacy of this period, I turn to one specific moment from Schaeffer’s early studio experiments with musique concrète in April 1948, showing how the theories of sound reproduction formed in the earlier time period informed practical decisions in Schaeffer’s working methods at a critical time when his ideas about the sound object were forming. Schaeffer’s studio practice and, to an extent, his theories of listening thus carry traces of this prior sonic culture. Considering the decisive influence of Schaeffer’s writings and teaching on later generations and developments in electroacoustic music, I speculate on the proliferation of these ideas beyond Schaeffer’s immediate circle, focusing in particular on soundscape composition. The title of this article is a reference to James Lastra’s ‘invisible auditor’, a term he coined to characterise the approach to sound reproduction discussed in this article (Lastra 2000: 159).","2017-08","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","161-171","","2","22","","","Inaudible Visitors","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/GAAKHZQD/Lautour - 2017 - Inaudible Visitors Theories of sound reproduction.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A year later, Dunn presented the work in New York as a ‘performance/documentation’, playing back the audio recording for a seated audience. This article explores issues of ‘liveness’ in recorded sound, ‘transparency’, ‘aura’ and ‘the work itself’ in order to examine the consequences of this act: what does it mean for a recording of an outdoor performance to be shared at an indoor concert event? Can such a complex and interactive experience – with widely dispersed musicians and mobile audience members – be successfully converted into a fixed document? What does a recording capture and what must it exclude? Because Sky Drift constantly shifts the physical relationships between musicians and audience across a vast outdoor landscape, each listener’s experience represents an equally valid sonic perspective on the piece. As a result, it is unclear how a satisfying recording might be made or what it might even mean to ‘hear the music’ at all. When relocated – away from its original outdoor context – Sky Drift is deprived of much of its potential to communicate meaning.","2017-04","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","122-129","","1","22","","","The Map and the Territory","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/C7ZCP9UI/Davis - 2017 - The Map and the Territory Documenting David Dunn’.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This artwork generates video and multi-channel sound output in real time, responding to changes in traffic patterns on an adjacent street. While the visuals are composed from pre-recorded content, the sound environment explores the use of site-specific sound within public urban space by sampling and processing sounds that occur naturally in and around the station. Regulations involving the artwork's volume resulted in the sound output being reduced to a level at which it was too subtle to be noticed amidst the busy activity of the station. It was therefore necessary to strengthen the artwork's aural presence without interfering with the subtleties of the site-specific sound environment. A dynamic field of sine tones and rhythmic glitches was composed to augment the more subtle sounds of the installation. This juxtaposition of site-specific sound with compositional structures associated with the popular musical genre known as microsound proved to be effective, calling attention to the mediated sound environment even at low volume levels and balancing the artwork's presence with the other functions of the site.","2008-04","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","2023-07-11 06:32:21","51-60","","1","13","","","Microsound in public space","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/B4KK4JDF/Anderson - 2008 - Microsound in public space compositional methods .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It draws on the idea that the connection between the human engagement with the interface itself (digital or analogue) and the resultant rich media output forms a proposed experiential dimension containing both technical and somatic considerations. The proposed dimension is characterised by its materiality and is referred to by the author as the techno-somatic dimension. The author proposes that the materiality of the techno-somatic dimension may be usefully examined as part of a re-consideration of the nature of interaction in systems where the input characteristics of the performer’s actions, the musician’s gesture, the dancer’s movements and so on are analysed and also drive the rich media content of the work in real time. The author will suggest that such a techno-somatic dimension exists in all human engagement with technologies, analogue or digital. Furthermore, the author is proposing that design and analysis efforts for new interactive systems should focus on the techno-somatic dimension; that, if this dimension is designed with care to produce a detailed and nuanced experience for the user, design specifications for the interface will automatically result; and that such an interface will produce the somatic and functional characteristics to produce the desired materiality and actional intentionality. For the purposes of this discussion, the author will focus principally on musical interfaces.","2015-04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","82-89","","1","20","","","Interaction as Material","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/TNWJ4KUG/Paine - 2015 - Interaction as Material The techno-somatic dimens.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Post-humanist concepts that question the categorical divide between nature and culture, following Donna Haraway and Bruno Latour, converge with contemporary, non-adaptationist evolutionary aesthetics. Therefore, the anthropocentric ‘othering’ of non-humans gives way to a concept of a more-than-human sociality of sound. We offer some theoretical propositions for the extension of socially engaged sound practices to collaborations between humans and non-human animals and between humans and artificial intelligences, and then exemplify such multispecies sonic collaborations by analysing some existing projects from the fields of sound art and musical performance. After drawing some more general conclusions from these analyses, we hint at potential aesthetical and ethical parallels between animal and AI creative agency. Finally, we point out a few questions we see as important for future advanced settings of such collaborations, especially when it comes to assemblages of different AI technologies and to future concepts of animal–computer interaction that might enable non-human animals and artificial intelligence to cooperate creatively.","2023-04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:05","35-42","","1","28","","","Sonic Collaborations between Humans, Non-human Animals and Artificial Intelligences","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/UNCIEFGG/Ullrich and Trump - 2023 - Sonic Collaborations between Humans, Non-human Ani.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Opposing stereotypes about the ‘barbaric Balkans’ often reinforced by Western media during the recent war in that region, Zagreb Everywhere provides a unique view of Zagreb and its inimitable features, while at the same time showing the experiences of that city and its people as having a broad human appeal and resonance. The piece exists in two formats: (i) a stand-alone video work, and (ii) a multimedia performance piece with projected visual images, sound, and live narration. After a brief recounting of the genesis of the idea for Zagreb Everywhere and the main aesthetic aspects of the project, this paper discusses the methods in which the sounds were collected in the field and compiled, how these sounds were edited in the studio, and how the entire piece was assembled.

The first stage, analysis, is a detailed documentation of the electronic processes and effects required for each work in a format that is independent of any specific device or system. The analysis provides a blueprint for future realisations using available technology. The second stage, reconstruction, provides a working performance resource, as well as a test case for the validity of the analysis. Reconstructed systems are then tested and refined through the third stage, performance. With repeated performances, compositions gain wider exposure and may be evaluated by listeners on their musical merits. To date, the author has analysed, reconstructed and performed several works for clarinet and interactive electronics. Each performance has informed the continued development of the newly reconstructed system, and has in some cases led to corrections to the underlying analysis. As a classically trained clarinettist and computer musician, the author's approach to the conservation of electroacoustic repertoire comes from a desire to find performable works and to keep them viable and accessible for as long as possible. Four works for clarinet and interactive electronics (by Musgrave, Pennycook, Kramer, and Lippe) are presented as test cases for this model.","2006-12","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:05","273-284","","3","11","","","A model for the conservation of interactive electroacoustic repertoire","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/4R4Y4VXV/Wetzel - 2006 - A model for the conservation of interactive electr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since its emergence from the World Soundscape Project, the concept of soundscape composition has set out to enhance our listening awareness of our soundscapes, inspiring and establishing a discourse that explores a sense of place through sound. Soundscape composition over the past decades has established itself as a popular compositional practice among acousmatic composers utilising compositional techniques that go beyond phonographic representation of acoustic environments. Electroacoustic techniques explore not only the transformation and processing of field recordings but also the spatialisation and performance techniques used to create immersive and realistic soundscapes. These compositional developments since the establishment of the World Soundscape Project have brought this genre of music to a wider audience as it has developed into a cross-disciplinary practice. Soundscape studies methodologies such as soundwalking, listening and recording are being utilised by a broader research cohort outside of soundscape composition. This article provides a survey of recent projects and compositions that incorporate a soundscape and cross-disciplinary approach that reflects a variety of cultural themes and issues within the disciplines of social, political and cultural science.","2018-04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:05","20-28","","1","23","","","Soundscape Composition","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/R5C8BAKQ/Martin - 2018 - Soundscape Composition Enhancing our understandin.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We discuss whether ecologically based music can be studied using linguistic tools. The concepts of potentiality and actuality are situated within the perspective of individual–environment interactions. A process that describes the relationship between an individual and his specific social context is proposed: the personal environment. Consistency is discussed in relation to environmental sound listening processes and ecological modelling work. The first part of the paper concludes by suggesting that form-creation is dynamically determined by a process of mutual adaptation between listener and environment. The second part focuses on compositional methods and contextual elements as they are used in The Trade. This work has been developed through a multilevel approach where visual and sonic materials stem from social and historical issues. The organisational processes of the sound piece are based on the micro-temporal and spectral properties suggested by the visual elements in the installation. The meso-temporal dynamic is organised through ecologically constrained events. The macro-structural shape and the sources used in the piece make reference to a specific historical context, i.e. the conquest of the American continent by the European armies during the first half of the sixteenth century.","2000-08","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:06","85-94","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/FVFQ29U8/Keller and Capasso - 2000 - Social and perceptual processes in the installatio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In exploring Gunn’s compositional decisions and the political and creative contexts which surrounded them, we detail his sonic practice and make the argument that Gunn was a soundscape composer before the term was coined, a forerunner of the genre indebted to composers connected with the World Soundscape Project. In doing so, we must acknowledge the ways in which the album’s creation and reception play out paradoxical aspects of the wilderness myth, while feeding into the construction of a popular and idealised Canadian identity. We also find his modernist ecological sensibility struggling to articulate a place for human visitors within nature: in this, Gunn’s outlook and concerns were not very different from some contemporary soundscape composers. However, this study goes beyond acknowledging a previously ‘unknown father’ of familiar sounds and debates; in contextualising his work with environmental sound as a contribution to the genre of the circadian audio portrait, we highlight an alternative genealogy for contemporary soundscape composition.","2017-08","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:06","206-216","","2","22","","","A Day in Algonquin Park","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/AB4P3PWN/Cameron and Rogalsky - 2017 - A Day in Algonquin Park William W.

What emerges from this documentation is a fascinating and at times significant insight into his compositional methods and underlying aesthetic, itself shaped and influenced by the changing nature of the technology itself. Whereas his earlier works have been subject to close scrutiny in this context far less attention has been paid to those composed in more recent years, involving the use of digital technologies. A key consideration in this context is the distinctive and highly individual nature of his approach to the resources at his disposal, in turn driven by aesthetic considerations which of necessity become embedded in the practicalities of realisation. Thus the study of the changing nature of his techné as new tools became available becomes a crucial consideration. This article examines these issues in the context of Octophonie (1991) and with particular reference to the concepts and practicalities addressed in his use of three-dimensional spatialisation.","2008-12","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:06","177-187","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/5YHSYMY7/Clarke and Manning - 2008 - The influence of technology on the composition of .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The multiple layers of sound that are nonlinear, interactive and dynamically mixed and effected in real time, place this media well outside the restrictions of traditional film, television and music and allow for experiences difficult to create in a more traditional real-world setting. The process of designing a broad concept audio environment for a computer game world can become a blueprint for the creation of a surround sound experience that has many similarities to sound installation practice. Creation and implementation of the sound content, the way in which it becomes interactive and the rules that drive the dynamic mixing are the processes by which the artist defines his or her vision of the final sound work. This paper aims to approach the use of a ‘next generation’ game console as a sound installation space, and discusses the ways in which a virtual audio environment created for a computer game is similar to a more traditional installation space. There are very real limitations for the implementation of soundscapes on computer game consoles, but a balance to these limitations is the capabilities of the surround sound hardware, support of powerful 3D audio engines and accessibility to a wide and diversified audience.","2003-08","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:06","171-180","","2","8","","","The creation of an audio environment as part of a computer game world","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/JMLU7YS4/Schütze - 2003 - The creation of an audio environment as part of a .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Abbie Conant, an internationally reco gnised trombonist, commissioned and performed Hysteria as part of her ‘Wired Goddess’ project. I chose five lines of poetry from John Campion's Tongue Stones: ‘matter/mater/meter/muthos’, ‘bowl of regeneration/quickener of wombs’, ‘follow the mysteries of your feet’, ‘Let dark ages be crucibles’ and ‘wounds like flowers opening’. With this text I created an implex of sonic images relating the body, fertility, menses and violence. The first line is particularly important and shapes the first two-thirds of the piece. The musical material complements the text and uses periodicity to suggest the body's heartbeat and breath. The heartbeat serves as a cantus firmus, occurring every five seconds, and pedal tones form the primary material for the trombone part and connect to the idea of breath. The punctuating gunshots occurring in the first half imply violence, and the dark red lighting suggests blood. The tape and trombone intertwine in a sonic world evoking the womb and regeneration. The four-channel tape heightens the sense of immersion that connected to the piece's resonance and dream-like atmosphere. The web of these associations constitutes an artistic reflection on the sensibility and experience of the feminine in a patriarchal society.","2003-04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:06","85-87","","1","8","","","Wounds like flowers opening","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/LY3RVBWI/Cox - 2003 - Wounds like flowers opening a discussion of Hyste.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This view is that of a computer programmer, rather than that of a user of computer programs written (or hardware constructed) by others. The programmer is in the unique position of being able to describe and manipulate abstract processes which may be used as a unique means of artistic expression. This gives a greater amount of freedom to the programmer/artist than is the case when he or she is limited by programmed procedures defined by others.Prior to the development of a formal means of specifying visual and aural events, a concrete machine or set of rules for their manipulation and a means of bringing these representations back into the world as physical events, abstract processes were things to be contemplated but not experienced. Musical and spatial notations employed by artists, engineers and others, in concert with the programming of computing hardware, have opened the way for those who wish to manipulate processes in their artistic practice.In order to focus study and practice in the area of such generative computer art, the Center for Electronic Media Art (CEMA) has been established in Melbourne, Australia. The Center has spawned an international conference series on generative/process-based electronic art called Iteration. The perceived roles of the Center and Iteration conferences are discussed in this paper.","2001-04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:06","47-53","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/2NYIANVC/Dorin - 2001 - Generative processes and the electronic arts.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

His idea of a gap between senses is based on electronic media like radio and telephone, but it gains new actuality in modern (multimedia) times. The new technology and its users have too experimented with the creative inversion of schizophony in sound and vision. Film sound design and film music combine sound in and out of context, composition works with contrapunctual audiovisions; video art and sound art, as in the work of Robert Cahen, combine and mix genres of all kinds and senses. MetaSon #5 Skruv Stockholm is an audiovisual soundwalk, based on soundscape recordings in Sweden in the 1970s and 1990s, combined with associative pictures and designs, each in its own rhythms and times. It consists less of the common meaning both share, being more dependent on the fluidity and dynamic of the relationship between the elements. Sound and image create an intermedium, intermodal space neither of which could project alone. From moment to moment, schizophonic montage and idea invert into a fresh, maybe evocative look at the way we perceive, where the audio flow transforms stable pictures into liquid forms, where image follows sound and is treated like sound.","2002-04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:06","73-78","","1","7","","","MetaSon #5 Skruv Stockholm","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/RV8V6LNL/Werner - 2002 - MetaSon #5 Skruv Stockholm turning schizophonic s.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The work is remarkable for the way in which spatiality is explored through new developments in graphic notation – both for three-dimensional and sound projection, and to indicate musical imitation and transformation of short-wave radio signals. These two notational systems unite through the synchronous unfolding of time in Pole, and similarly through the spatial structure of auditorium’s architecture that housed over 50 loudspeakers in 6 layers. By using the sound projection score as the basis for the construction of a NURBS (non-uniform rational B-spline) model, each of the player’s sound projection geometries within the auditorium can be transmediated, thus allowing for a visual representation of the spatial design of the work. Examining the topology of the models produced from the work’s six sections further allows for emergent architectonic characteristics of volume, manifold and envelope to be tracked, thus pointing to Stockhausen’s characterisation of design space. The strong connection of the work to the auditorium’s spherical structure also points to the nature of the composer’s sound design as one predicated on the ability of patterns of sound projection to articulate tangible space, and therefore produce ephemeral aural architectures.","2010-12","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:06","185-197","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/FHTBGWHF/Fowler - 2010 - The Ephemeral Architecture of Stockhausen’s Pole f.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I discuss how micro-watt radio pioneer Mbanna Kantako, electronic music artist Muqata’a and audio activist Christopher DeLaurenti work with field recordings to produce subversive counter-narratives against news media and state discourses. I outline three specific sound projects as case studies: Kantako’s aural counter-surveillance of police encounters within the predominantly poor and Black neighbourhood of Springfield, Illinois; Muqata’a’s album Inkanakuntu (2018) composed using field recordings of Ramallah, West Bank; and DeLaurenti’s radio piece Fit the Description (2015) that incorporates field recordings of the protests following the 2014 police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. I argue that composing with soundscapes of contested urban spaces can function as sonic activism that confronts the oppressive soundscapes of systemic racism. The case studies are examined through the following common themes: 1) the use of what I term aural counterpublics to amplify marginalised voices and soundscapes of resistance, and 2) the radical re-appropriation of microphones and oppressive police and military audio technologies as a means of ‘speaking back’ to systems of power. Finally, I suggest how these case studies convey the need for intersectional and decolonised approaches to soundscape studies.","2021-08","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:06","201-210","","2","26","","","Soundscapes of Resistance","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/6Z8HJAS9/Yoganathan - 2021 - Soundscapes of Resistance Amplifying social justi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some sound art has privileged a relationship with visual arts and the structuring of objects in curated spaces (Licht 2007), others with the sound worlds beyond the exhibition (Schafer 1994). By examining a specific sound art installation, Sound and Seclusion by Tim Shaw, this article reworks the idea of sonorous objects as artefacts displaying different kinds of representations, knowledges or data. This question of sonorous ‘knowledge-objects’ is particularly important as ‘collected sounds’ become incorporated into compositions away from their, often remote, spatio-temporal origin out there in the landscape. This article raises three areas for discussion. First, what can sonorous objects tell us about the pre-compositional world (Impett 2007)? Second, in what ways can we understand sonorous objects as they are reworked in compositions which re-narrate them? Third, how can we understand sonorous objects as traces and pieces of data as well as aesthetic productions? The article concludes with a case for reworking the very idea of a sonorous object in sound practices as a product of dead logics and dead worlds as it emerges in new ensembles of composition away from its origin.","2015-08","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:06","263-272","","2","20","","","Dead Logics and Worlds","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/5Y23KEMB/Hudson and Shaw - 2015 - Dead Logics and Worlds Sound art and sonorous obj.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It takes its impetus from a workshop aimed at forming a ‘cross-species choir’ by the artist Catherine Clover, in which participants tried to sing like, with and to birds in a London woodland. I describe how Clover’s speculative choir was informed by theoretical models drawn both from sound studies and from environmental humanities, as well as a down-to-earth, humorous sensitivity towards the limitations and absurdities of artistic practice. Where much theory associated with sound art and experimental music sees sound as what Ochoa Gautier has critiqued as an ontological suture for repairing the fractured relationship between humans and nature, Clover’s practice offers a more ambivalent and, I argue, therefore more generative means of conceptualising the role of sound within more-than-human social worlds. In particular, it uses sound to draw attention to the apprehension of humans by other creatures and to various dynamics of evasion, non-encounter and undecidability in our relationships with the more-than-human world. By amplifying this alternative way of understanding sound and listening, this article seeks to recast projects of social engagement through sound in more speculative and expansive terms.","2021-08","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:07","179-189","","2","26","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/IEISTBNR/Browning - 2021 - Sound and More-than-Human Sociality in Catherine C.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Beyond this my installation works conceive of space in its site-specificity, usually existing in several layers: a social layer, a historical-political layer and a situational layer. This concept of space is thus not limited to interior spaces and architectonic-formal relationships, a position which naturally also defines my working methods: only subjective, on-site research yields the theme and concept of an installation. I call such installations sound situations, following the ‘conscious creation of situations’ conceived by Guy Debord (International Situationists) in the 1950s. This means first that I open myself up to situations – usually in public spaces – in order to sense their site-specific tensions and to draw them out in all their possible relationships. Secondly, I alter these situations in order to make them more dense through intensification. The concept can be defined as articulating the space, the site; for this reason I prefer to work with site-specific acoustic and visual material found at the site, but also introduce foreign material when it serves to reinforce communication with the site and its occupants and visitors.","2003-08","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:04","2023-07-11 06:34:07","187-193","","2","8","","","From the sound installation to the sound situation","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/LWX65J2Y/Klein - 2003 - From the sound installation to the sound situation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A number of key points are addressed in this formulation: making/unmaking and ‘public making’; the assembling/disassembling of sonic devices and artefacts in the performance space; sound ‘through’ materials and materials at hand; and site and architectural features as material. In addition, readymade actions, illustrated by George Brecht’s The Cabinet, and the relationship between audience and performer are also presented. The article continues by outlining practice undertaken by the authors comprising two UK tours: ‘Sacrificial Floors’, 2018 with Tetsuya Umeda; and ‘Points of Failure’, 2020. Derek Bailey’s idea of ‘instrumental impulse’ is extended to include the concepts of expanded and reduced instruments that encompass ‘instrument as object’ and ‘raw material as instrument’. ‘Instrument’ is also viewed as a distributed mesh-like structure in which collective improvisation may occur. Borrowing from Ingold, ‘wayfaring’ is used to describe improvising with materials found ‘along the way’. Silent actions, uncontrollable instruments, unstable systems, performative failures, reimagined affordance of objects, ‘playing with resource’ and ‘improvising inside electronics’ are all addressed in relation to performance-installation. Finally, the authors explore the idea of ‘virtuosity in listening’, and question sonic autonomy and self-expression in improvisation and how ‘attending to sound’ can be an active part of improvised performance.","2022-08","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","144-155","","2","27","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/G5F2JL72/Richards and Shaw - 2022 - Improvisation through Performance-installation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our systems, built on top of Web technologies, enable novel possibilities of collective and collaborative interaction, in particular by simplifying public access to the artwork by presenting the work through the web browser of their smartphone/tablet. Additionally, such a technical framework can be extended with so-called nano-computers, microprocessors and sensors. The infrastructure is completely agnostic as to how many clients are attached, or how they connect, which means that if the work is available in a public space, groups of friends, or even informally organised flash mobs, may engage with the work and perform the contents of the work at any time, and if available over the Internet, at any place. More than the technical details, the specific artistic directions or the supposed autonomy of the agents of our systems, this article focuses on how such ‘networks of devices’ interleave with the ‘network of humans’ composed of the people visiting the installation or participating in the concert. Indeed, we postulate that an important point in understanding and describing such proposals is to consider the relation between these two networks, the way they co-exist and entangle themselves through perception and action. To exemplify these ideas, we present a number of case studies, sound installations and concert works, very different in scope and artistic goal, and examine how this interaction is materialised from several standpoints.","2021-12","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","333-339","","3","26","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/YWIQ795Y/Bevilacqua et al. - 2021 - On Designing, Composing and Performing Networked C.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most studies assume timbres have fixed inter-relationships, but we tested whether distinct tasks change these. Thirty short sounds were used, from five categories: acoustic instruments, impulse responses, convolutions of the preceding, environmental sounds and computer-manipulated instrumental sounds. In Task 1, 46 non-musicians formed a ‘cohesive’ sonic ordering of unlabelled icons (sounds attached). In Task 2, they categorised the icons into four boxes. In Task 3 listeners separately ordered the sounds from each of Task 2’s boxes using the approach of Task 1. Tasks 1 and 2/3 revealed distinct orderings, consistent with conceptual flexibility. To analyse the orderings, we replaced conventional distance by adjacency measures, and described each system as a network (rather than spatial positions), confirming that the two task outcomes were distinct. Network analyses also showed that the two systems were mechanistically distinct and allowed us to predict temporally changing networks, modelling the observed networks as successive perceptions. Further simulated networks generated with the temporal model readily encompassed all possible pairings between the sounds and not just those we observed. The temporal network model thus confirms conceptual flexibility even in untrained listeners, clearly suitable for a composer to use.","2023-06-19","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","1-14","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/47NWH9H4/Dean et al. - 2023 - Flexibility Conceiving Relationships between Timbr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These permit the incorporation of sound distortions produced by the real space, the body and the auditory system into low-, middle- and large-scale musical structures, allowing sound spatialisation to become a fundamental parameter of the three compositions presented here. An important characteristic of these pieces is the exclusive use of sine waves and other time-invariant sound signals. Even though these types of signals present no alterations in time, it is possible to perceive pitch, loudness and tone-colour variations when they move in space, due to the psychoacoustic processes involved in spatial hearing. To emphasise the perception of such differences, this research proposes dividing a tone into multiple sound units and spreading these in space using several loudspeakers arranged around the listener. In addition to the perception of sound attribute variations, it is also possible to create dynamic rhythms and textures that depend almost exclusively on how sound units are arranged in space. Such compositional procedures help to overcome to some degree the unnaturalness implicit when using synthetic-generated sounds; through them, it is possible to establish cause–effect relationships between sound movement, on the one hand, and the perception of sound attribute, rhythm and texture variations on the other. Another important consequence is the possibility of producing diffuse sound fields independently of the levels of reverberation in the room, and to create sound spaces of a particular spatial depth without using artificial delay or reverb.","2018-12","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","296-307","","3","23","","","Filling Sound with Space","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/5ZKK94HB/Robusté - 2018 - Filling Sound with Space An elemental approach to.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Cinematic Spatial Sound Display (CSSD) was originally conceived for interactive panorama video installations, but the architecture goes beyond this particular application. The CSSD is characterised by its scalability to various loudspeaker configurations. It spatialises sound from dry sound files or live sources using control data that describe the spatial scenes. The time lines for source positions and other experimental parameters can be stored and edited in the CSSD, and the system can also process live user input to control selected parameters. The CSSD is more than just a sound positioning tool, and the underlying Virtual Microphone Control (ViMiC) technology was developed to support artists in designing new forms of spatial imagery. The software enables the user to create computer-generated rooms with virtual microphones and sound sources. The algorithm uses physical laws to auralise acoustic scenes – allowing realistic effects such as the Doppler shift and the simulation of various classical microphone techniques. Various parameters of ViMiC can be adjusted in real time, including the directivity patterns and orientations of both the microphones and sound sources as well as their precise locations. Surreal scenes can be created by assigning artificial directivity patterns to microphones or changing the laws of physics in the model. An algorithm to extract the sound-source positions in recordings using a microphone array is also part of the CSSD. The algorithm was specifically designed to operate in multiple sound-source scenarios and can also be used for telematic music applications.","2010-12","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","260-270","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/MRP2TNZM/Braasch et al. - 2010 - A Cinematic Spatial Sound Display for Panorama Vid.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such a concept is understood as mental representations motivated by sonic stimuli that reach the listener in an acousmatic listening situation and that can be determined by a focus on either the intrinsic or extrinsic aspects of the sounds – or even a combination of both. The intrinsic aspects are related to the inner characteristics of the sounds and are, therefore, accessed through reduced listening. They are not dependent on the identification of the sources that caused the sounds or possible meanings and connotations conveyed by them. The extrinsic aspects, on the other hand, are the connotations, meanings and references that lay outside the sounds themselves and that can be related to human experience in a broader sense, including domains other than the sonic. Since sonic images are not exclusively dependent on intrinsic factors, they can be the result of various kinds of listening attitudes not restricted to reduced listening. The article highlights the links between ideas presented by different authors who approach the issue of sonic image or who present considerations on other issues that may inform an understanding of sonic image in the acousmatic context. Since sonic image is dependent both on the intrinsic and the extrinsic aspects of sound, it is argued that it is a concept that can integrate (and possibly unify) different approaches related to acousmatic listening. The considerations on sonic image presented here touch issues regarding different listening attitudes, the relationships between sound and source, and links between sound and gesture, amongst other aspects. The approach taken here is focused as much as possible on the perspective of the listener rather than on the composer, although some considerations related to compositional thinking are occasionally exposed.","2010-04","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","35-42","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/7I5KPKQF/Barreiro - 2010 - Sonic Image and Acousmatic Listening.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Electroacoustic media shape our perceptive realities. There are multiple tools available to record and reproduce sound, but is it possible to handle the fleeting nature of sound, the escape of sound? Certainly there are tools to manipulate sound, to create new soundscapes in this way. We can generate virtual sound-projecting soundscapes via speakers, via headphones in a new context - but what are we listening to?Every sound evokes images. The concept of ‘musique acousmatique’, according to François Bayle, amplifies Pierre Schaeffer's notion of the ‘objet sonore’. ‘Musique acousmatique’ refers to sound projection, and thus to our imagination while concentrating on listening. In listening to acousmatic music, we can find three tonal levels, and this tripartite concept of listening refers to the tripartite semiotic concept introduced by Charles Sanders Peirce.Finally, sound affects us emotionally. In contradiction to the term ‘objet sonore’, the term ‘sound event’ coined by R. Murray Schafer stresses the necessity to analyse sound in its context. It is the sonic environment which determines the meaning of the ‘sound event’. Thus, from my point of view, the concept of soundscape can be compared with Ferdinand de Saussure's semiotic theory about the arbitrary meaning of signs. Signs are determined by their systems.Semiotic concepts offer an interesting approach to sound perception. Let's listen to soundscapes before sound escapes.","2002-04","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","15-19","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/NFBWABJJ/Proy - 2002 - Sound and sign.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this paper is to question and explore why this ostensibly benign and increasingly common procedure (i.e. the routine of soundscape recording/sampling/abstracting, editing, retouching, transforming, mixing, recontextualising . . . ) may result in a durable confrontation with ‘terror’ accompanied by ethical compromise. To articulate a personal and intuitive response, I will refer to critical writings on photography to illuminate sound (i.e. utilising the photograph as a counterpoint to the sonic record). I will be focusing in particular on the recording and the reappropriation of human utterance in electro-acoustic music, as it is probably the most intimate, as well as familiar, sonic material to humans. You cannot escape from your own voice. ‘Soundscape’ denotes ‘any acoustic field of study’ (Schafer 1994: 7); however, in this context I wish to focus on acoustic fields which have a particular social or cultural significance.‘To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed.’ (Sontag 1984: 4) Thus it is appropriated again when employed in sound art.","1999-01","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","25-29","","1","4","","","The exploitation of ‘tangible ghosts’","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/NH57XCV5/Drever - 1999 - The exploitation of ‘tangible ghosts’ conjectures.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The text reveals two different discourses. The German texts on Klangkunst (sound art in German) focus upon the sound material’s relation to a spatial location where sound sculptures and installations are given central focus. These are genres that transcend the old divisions between spatial arts (Raumkunst) and the time-based arts (Zeitkunst). A strong emphasis on the dual aspect of seeing and hearing could be described as a central point of departure. Klangkunst concerns an investigation of both time and space, through ear and eye. In the English literature on sound art, there are often references to sound’s inner aesthetical qualities. The perspectives on sound’s relation to room is evident also here, but the perspectives are however broader, in the sense that the aspects of space and locality are diversified and pluralistic. One will find an even larger scope of literature and references if the area of sound art also includes cultural-studies perspectives on sound, sonic experiences and acoustic phenomena, the influx of new technologies on the everyday soundscape, and sound design. These are areas often referred to when speaking about the ‘sonic turn’. The way the term sound art is handled in English texts is often very vague. The German study of Klangkunst developed within the academic field of musicology. There has been a fruitful collaboration between musicologists, publishing houses, music journals, galleries, academic institutions and higher art education, which together has helped to establish Klangkunst as an artistic expression and theoretical discourse. This strong intellectual infrastructure has been important in the ‘construction’ of the concept Klangkunst. The two separate theoretical discourses not only deal with the concept of sound art differently. Although many of the artists are dealt with in both the English and the German literature, there are very seldom references to the German literature in the English texts. This tendency is not reciprocal.","2009-04","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","11-18","","1","14","","","Sound Art or Klangkunst?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/CXDNXBL9/Engström and Stjerna - 2009 - Sound Art or Klangkunst A reading of the German a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While these scholarly insights help us in understanding the nature of sound within a multidimensional timbral space, they carry little meaning for the majority of musicians. To help address this, we conducted two experiments to establish listeners’ perceptual thresholds (PT) for changes in sound using a staircase-procedure. Unlike most timbre perception research, these changes were sonic manipulations that are common in synthesisers, audio processors and instruments familiar to musicians and producers, and occurred within continuous sounds (rather than between discrete pairs of sounds). In experiment 1, two sounds (variants of a sawtooth oscillation) both with the same fundamental frequency (F1: 80 Hz, 240 Hz or 600 Hz) were played with no intervening gap. In each trial, the two sounds’ partials differed in amplitudes or frequencies to produce a timbre change. The sonic manipulations were varied in size to detect thresholds for the perceived timbre change – listeners were instructed to indicate whether or not they perceived a change within the sound. In experiment 2, we modified stimulus presentation to introduce the factor of transition time (TT). Rather than occurring instantaneously (as in experiment 1), the timbre manipulations were introduced gradually over the course of a 100 ms or a 1000 ms TT. Results revealed that PTs were significantly affected by the manipulations in experiment 1, and additionally by TT in experiment 2. Importantly, the data revealed an interaction between the F1 and the timbre manipulations, such that there were differential effects of timbre changes on the perceptual system depending on pitch height. Musicians (n=11) showed significantly smaller PTs compared to non-musicians (n=10). However, PTs for musicians and non-musicians were highly correlated (r=.83) across different sonic manipulations, indicating similar perceptual patterns in both. We hope that by establishing PTs for commonly used timbre manipulations, we can provide musicians with a general perceptual unit, for each manipulation, that can guide music composition and assessment.","2019-04","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","2023-07-11 06:34:44","71-84","","1","24","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/RXL9NNAG/Dobrowohl et al. - 2019 - Controlling Perception Thresholds for Changing Tim.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At times the relationship between emotion and sonification has been contentious due to an implied overlap with music. This paper clarifies the relationship, demonstrating how it can be mutually beneficial. After identifying contexts favourable to auditory display of emotion, and the utility of its development to research in musical emotion, the current state of the field is addressed, reiterating the necessary conditions for sound to qualify as a sonification of emotion. With this framework, strategies for display are presented that use acoustic and structural cues designed to target select auditory-cognitive mechanisms of musical emotion. Two sonifications are then described using these strategies to convey arousal and valence though differing in design methodology: one designed ecologically, the other computationally. Each model is sampled at 15-second intervals at 49 evenly distributed points on the AV space, and evaluated using a publically available tool for computational music emotion recognition. The computational design performed 65 times better in this test, but the ecological design is argued to be more useful for emotional communication. Conscious of these limitations, computational design and evaluation is supported for future development.","2014-04","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","60-69","","1","19","","","Sonification of Emotion","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/JTIRS57D/Winters and Wanderley - 2014 - Sonification of Emotion Strategies and results fr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The conceptual implications of its use within the digital medium and the possibility for the formation of higher-order structures are discussed. Grond and Hermann's notion of ‘familiarity’ is used to illustrate the difference between audification and non-standard synthesis, and the contexts of auditory display and music respectively. Familiarity is given as being determined by Dombois and Eckel's categories of data. Kubisch's Electrical Walks, Xenakis's GENDYN and the audification of seismograms are used as examples. Bogost's concept of the alien is introduced, and its relevance to the New Aesthetic and Algorave are discussed.

Coming from the disciplines of computer sciences and human computer interface (HCI), the conceptualisation of sonification has been mostly driven by application areas and methods. On the other hand, the sonic arts, which have always participated in the auditory display community, have a genuine focus on sound. Despite these close interdisciplinary relationships between communities of sound practitioners, a rich and sound- or listening-centred concept of sonification is still missing for design guidelines. Complementary to the useful organisation by fields of application, a proper conceptual framework for sound needs to be abstracted from applications and also to some degree from tasks, as both are not directly related to sound. As an initial approach to recasting the thinking about sonification, we propose a conceptualisation of sonifications along two poles in which sound serves either a normative or a descriptive purpose. According to these two poles, design guidelines can be developed proper to display purposes and listening modes.","2014-04","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","41-51","","1","19","","","Interactive Sonification for Data Exploration","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/PU82B573/Grond and Hermann - 2014 - Interactive Sonification for Data Exploration How.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, metaphors based on musical textures are used to describe different approaches to the audiovisual medium.

The design of the sound space is guided by four principles which match perceptual structure with data structure to improve natural comprehension of an auditory display. These principles – completeness, comprehensibility, consistency, and cohesiveness – have been generalised from the use of colour displays in scientific visualisation. The choice of perceptual parameters to represent different types of data is informed by the body of psychoacoustic literature. The raw material for the construction of the sound space is the McGill University Master Samples (MUMS) palette of musical instrument samples. This is an important choice because this reference resource enables reproduction and confirmation of the results. The construction was carried out in four stages – the ‘pedestal’, the ‘skin’, the ‘skeleton’ and the ‘flesh’. The pedestal consists of eight equally discriminable timbres organised in a circle by perceptual similarity. The skin is the boundary of variation in the space, defining the limits of dynamic range for pitch and brightness at each timbre. The skeleton characterises the internal behaviour of the space at a number of perceptually measured points. The flesh is a continuous medium moulded to the skeleton and skin, realised by a three-dimensional (3D) regularised linear spline interpolation. The concrete realisation of the sound space can be investigated through a user interface, called the GamutExplorer. Colour visualisations of slices and wireframe views of the 3D space can be chosen, and sounds can be picked with a mouse.","1996-08","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","125-136","","2","1","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/7CZ95Q3H/Barrass - 1996 - Sculpting a sound space with information propertie.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
