Most ensembles deploy such listening to some extent; however, the distinction between general ensemble playing and interdependent listening is structural, describing situations in which the interdependence generates the content. This socially driven approach can be observed historically in works by Christian Wolff, Cornelius Cardew and Pauline Oliveros and underpins recent works by the author of this article, particularly within the project Super Critical Mass. In Super Critical Mass events, temporary communities use homogeneous sound sources to create works whose structures evolve from the performers’ interconnections.","2016","2023-07-10 06:58:10","2023-07-10 06:58:10","2023-07-10 06:58:10","74-76","","","26","","","From You to Me and Back Again","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: The MIT Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approach applies parameter-mapping sonification and is currently implemented in an application called Cheddar, which was programmed in Max/MSP. Cheddar sonifies data in real time, where the user can modify a wide variety of temporal, spatial, and sonic parameters during the listening process, and thus more easily uncover patterns and processes in the data than when applying non-real-time, noninteractive techniques. The design draws on existing literature concerning perception and acoustics, and it applies the author's practical experience in acousmatic composition, spectromorphology, and sound semantics, while addressing accuracy, flexibility, and ease of use. Although previous sonification applications have addressed some degree of real-time control and spatialization, this approach integrates space and sound in an interactive framework. Spatial information is sonified in high-order 3-D ambisonics, where the user can interactively move the virtual listening position to reveal details easily missed from fixed or noninteractive spatial views. Sounds used as input to the sonification take advantage of the rich spectra and extramusical attributes of acoustic sources, which, although previously theorized, are investigated here in a practical context thoroughly tested alongside acoustic and psychoacoustic considerations. Furthermore, when using Cheddar, no specialized knowledge of programming, acoustics, or psychoacoustics is required. These approaches position Cheddar at the junction between science and art. With one application serving both disciplines, the patterns and processes of science are more fluently appropriated into music or sound art, and vice versa for scientific research, science public outreach, and education.","2016","2023-07-10 07:08:48","2023-07-10 07:08:48","2023-07-10 07:08:37","47-69","","2","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: The MIT Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/QTHBI4JW/Barrett - 2016 - Interactive Spatial Sonification of Multidimension.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have chosen this particular case because of its relative simplicity and interesting dynamic behavior, which makes it suitable for a novel sonification mapping that can be applied to standard synthesis techniques, resulting in the generation of appealing sounds. In addition, this sonification might provide useful insight into the behavior of the quantum particle. In particular, this model exhibits quantum revivals, minimizes uncertainty, and exhibits similarities to the case of a classical bouncing ball. The proposed model has been implemented in real time in both the Max/MSP and the Pure Data environments. The algorithm is based on concepts of additive synthesis where each oscillator describes the eigenfunctions that characterize the state evolution of the wave packet. We also provide an analysis of the sounds produced by the model from both a physical and a perceptual point of view.","2014","2023-07-10 07:09:20","2023-07-10 07:09:20","2023-07-10 07:09:11","53-67","","4","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: The MIT Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the extreme case, performers at all sites slow to match their delayed counterparts, resulting in a steadily decreasing temp. Introducing video of a conductor does not immediately solve the problem, as conductor video is also subjected to network latencies. This article lays the groundwork for an alternative approach to mitigating the effects of latency in distributed orchestral performances, based on generation of a predicted version of the conductor's baton trajectory. The prediction step is the most fundamental problem in this scheme, for which we propose the use of conventional machine learning techniques. Specifically, we demonstrate a particle filter and an extended Kalman filter that each track the location of the baton's tip and predict it multiple beats into the future; we compare these with a conventional feature-based method. We also describe a generic two-part framework that prescribes the incorporation of rehearsal data into a probabilistic model, which is then adapted during live performance. Finally, we suggest a framework and experimental methodology for establishing perceptually based metrics for predicted baton paths. Note that the perceptual efficacy of the presented methods requires experimental confirmation beyond the scope of this article.","2013","2023-07-10 07:09:20","2023-07-10 07:09:20","2023-07-10 07:09:18","28-45","","2","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: The MIT Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These interfaces work well when the movement and resulting sound are smooth and continuous, but it has proven difficult to design air instruments that trigger discrete sounds with precision that feels natural to performers and allows them to play rhythmically complex music. This article presents a study of ""air drumming"" gestures. Participants performed drumming-like gestures in time to simple recorded rhythms. These movements were recorded and examined to look for aspects of the movement that correspond to the timing of the sounds. The goal is to understand what we do with our bodies when we gesture in the air to trigger a sound. Two movement features of the hand are studied: Hits are the moment where the hand changes direction at the end of the striking gesture, and acceleration peaks are sharp peaks in magnitude acceleration as the hand decelerates. Hits and acceleration peaks are also detected for the movement of the wrist. It is found that the acceleration peaks are more useful than the hits because they occur earlier and with less variability, and their timing changes less with note speed. It is also shown that timing differences between hand and wrist features can be used to group performers into different movement styles.","2015","2023-07-10 07:09:59","2023-07-10 07:09:59","2023-07-10 07:09:54","47-66","","2","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: The MIT Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In presenting this holistic approach to mapping techniques, we apply the framework to existing works from the literature as well as to new implementations that consider this approach in their construction. As any mapping control structure for a given digital instrument is determined by the musical context in which it is used, we present musical examples that relate the relatively abstract realm of mapping design to the physically and perceptually grounded notions of control and sonic gesture. Making this connection allows mapping to be more clearly seen as a linkage between a physical action and a sonic result. In this sense, the purpose of this work is to translate the discussion on mapping so that it links an abstract and formalized approach—intended for representation and conceptualization—with a viewpoint that considers mapping in its role as a perceived correspondence between physical materials (i.e., those that act on controllers and transducers) and sonic events.

These systems furnished performers and composers with a wealth of opportunities to enhance the spatial contrast, motion, and musical articulations latent in the music. Although loudspeaker orchestras, stereo diffusion, and—more recently—hybrid performance techniques remain alive, especially in Europe, there is a trend towards fixed installation, high-density loudspeaker arrays (HDLAs), which I will call permanent HDLAs to differentiate them from loudspeaker-orchestra HDLAs. Permanent HDLAs (P-HDLAs) stimulate alternative approaches to musical space and pose challenges in both spatial composition and performance, encompassing both technology and aesthetics. This article consolidates many of the technical and aesthetic approaches that I have found specific to P-HDLAs with an emphasis on the application of higher-order Ambisonics (HOA) at fourth-order 3-D and above—what I will call V-HOA (“very high-order” Ambisonics) as distinguished from lower orders, or L-HOA (lower than fourth-order HOA). These approaches are guided by spatial-audio research, and then developed in a musical context. The study is divided into three sections: a description of musical and technical approaches that I have found to function over different P-HDLA installations; reflections on the compromises of lower-order monitoring during the compositional process; and presentation of the “Virtualmonium”: an instrument for the performance of stereo works that benefits from the growing popularity of P-HDLA installations.","2016","2023-07-10 07:10:47","2023-07-10 07:10:47","2023-07-10 07:10:41","35-46","","4","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: The MIT Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Potential models include treating the spatialized electronic sound in analogy to the diffusion pattern of the instrument, with spatial dimensions parametrized as functions of timbral features. Another approach is to map the concert hall as a three-dimensional projection of the instrument’s internal physical layout, a kind of virtual sonic microscope. Or, the diffusion of electronic spatial sound can be treated as an independent polyphonic element, complementary to but not dependent upon the instrument’s own spatial characteristics. Cartographies (2014), for piano with two performers and electronics, explores each of these models individually and in combination, as well as their technical implementation with the Meyer Sound Matrix3 system of the Südwestrundfunk Experimentalstudio in Freiburg, Germany, and the 43.4-channel Klangdom of the Institut für Musik und Akustik at the Zentrum für Kunst und Media in Karlsruhe, Germany. The process of composing, producing, and performing the work raises intriguing questions, and invaluable hints, for the composition and performance of live interactive works with HDLAs in the future.","2017","2023-07-10 07:10:47","2023-07-10 07:10:47","2023-07-10 07:10:45","61-75","","1","41","","","Mapping the Klangdom Live","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: The MIT Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The term ""audio"" is used here to distinguish from generative ""music"" systems, emphasizing the strong coupling between processes governing the production of high-level music and lower-level audio. The classical time-invariant implementation of an all-pass filter is subject to issues of instability that can arise when time-invariant filter parameters are allowed to vary over time. These instabilities are examined, along with the adoption of a power-preserving rotation matrix formulation of the all-pass filter to ensure stability and ultimately an improved synthesis for a generative audio system.","2016","2023-07-10 07:10:47","2023-07-10 07:10:47","2023-07-10 07:10:46","54-69","","1","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: The MIT Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hall is surrounded by a 350-loudspeaker array for sound-field reproduction using holophonic approaches such as wave-field synthesis and higher-order Ambisonics. First we present the design and implementation of the audio system and discuss the challenges of both hardware and software architectures. This is followed by a discussion of spatial composition techniques, aesthetic approaches, and methodologies for composing computer music for high-density loudspeaker arrays, explored through the paradigmatic examples of pieces produced by two artist-in-research residencies.","2016","2023-07-10 07:10:47","2023-07-10 07:10:47","2023-07-10 07:10:47","14-34","","4","40","","","Holophonic Sound in IRCAM’s Concert Hall","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: The MIT Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
