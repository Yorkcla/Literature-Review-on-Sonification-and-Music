The evaluation, which was conducted over several weeks and used a range of complementary objective and subjective measures to assess users' performance and preferences, is described. The findings from the evaluation with nine visually impaired student participants are presented. The results from this research can be applied to the design and evaluation of other non-visual hypermedia systems, such as auditory World Wide Web (WWW) browsers and digital talking books.","1999-01-01","2023-07-12 05:31:32","2023-07-12 05:31:32","2023-07-12 05:31:24","18-26","","1","18","","","Auditory navigation in hyperspace","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/014492999119219","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/YAMKNU7S/Morley et al. - 1999 - Auditory navigation in hyperspace Design and eval.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this design, the salient components of graphical interfaces are transformed into auditory interfaces. Based on a hierarchical model of the graphical interface, the auditory interface utilizes auditory icons to convey interface objects. Users navigate the interface by traversing its hierarchical structure. This design results in a usable interface that meets the needs of blind users and provides many of the benefits of graphical interfaces.","1997-03-01","2023-07-12 05:31:32","2023-07-12 05:31:32","2023-07-12 05:31:25","7-45","","1-2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/07370024.1997.9667239","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/DL6WPABT/Mynatt - 1997 - Transforming Graphical Interfaces Into Auditory In.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

African music traditions feature unique approaches to musical elements, make extensive use of cognitive phenomena in ways different from Western music, and have different relationships with other art forms. Building upon ethnomusicological research and intercultural collaboration, my approach to teaching concepts from African traditions, which is not intended as an antidote to Western cultural practices but as a broadening of horizons, does not promote imitation or appropriation, leading instead to the development of innovative musical ideas through an understanding of African music practices. In this article, I address a curricular innovation in tertiary art music composition pedagogy: experimental music composition based on concepts from African music traditions. I describe my personal experiences in purposefully undertaking sustained activities in this direction; I explain why I believe this course of study to be valuable in decolonisation and enhancing creativity; and I suggest outcomes to which this might lead.

The results showed that perceived SRT duration and ratings of perceived anxiety, stress, and impatience increased as ticking rate increased. However, with a slow rate (2-sec ticking), participants underestimated the duration of SRT, but indicated a significant increase in negative affect as compared with silent conditions.

Sound is a largely unexploited medium of output, even though it plays an integral role in our everyday encounters with the world, a role that is complementary to vision. Sound should be used in computers as it is in the world, where it conveys information about the nature of sound-producing events. Such a strategy leads to auditory icons, which are everyday sounds meant to convey information about computer events by analogy with everyday events. Auditory icons are an intuitively accessible way to use sound to provide multidimensional, organized information to users. These ideas are instantiated in the SonicFinder, which is an auditory interface I developed at Apple Computer, Inc. In this interface, information is conveyed using auditory icons as well as standard graphical feedback. I discuss how events are mapped to auditory icons in the SonicFinder, and illustrate how sound is used by describing a typical interaction with this interface. Two major gains are associated with using sound in this interface: an increase in direct engagement with the model world of the computer and an added flexibility for users in getting information about that world. These advantages seem to be due to the iconic nature of the mappings used between sound and the information it is to convey. I discuss sound effects and source metaphors as methods of extending auditory icons beyond the limitations implied by literal mappings, and I speculate on future directions for such interfaces.","1989-03-01","2023-07-12 05:31:32","2023-07-12 05:31:32","2023-07-12 05:31:27","67-94","","1","4","","","The SonicFinder","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15327051hci0401_3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article outlines the Mathtalk project, which addressed this problem by using computers to produce multimodal renderings of mathematical information. This example is unusual in that it is essential to use multiple modalities because of the nature and the difficulty of the application. In addition, the emphasis is on nonvisual (and hence novel) modalities. Crucial to designing a usable auditory interface to algebra notation is an understanding of the differences between visual and listening reading, particularly those aspects that make the former active and the latter passive. A discussion of these differences yields the twin themes of compensation for lack of external memory and provision of control over information flow. These themes were addressed by: the introduction of prosody to convey algebraic structure in synthetically spoken expressions; the provision of structure-based browsing functions; and the use of a prosody-based musical glance based on algebra earcons. The addition of prosody, when compared to a traditional method of presenting spoken algebra, was experimentally shown to increase the recovery of algebraic structure, enhance the retention of content, and reduce mental workload. These three factors can be said to compensate for the lack of an adequate external memory. Evaluations showed that the browsing functions and associated command language gave the fast and accurate control over information flow that is necessary for active reading. The algebra earcon was experimentally shown to convey the presence, location, and size of algebraic constructs within an expression in a manner that might be used as a rapid glance. Finally, an evaluation of the integrated components showed that the design principles derived from the Mathtalk program can give a more usable, active reading of algebra notation than that possible with traditional methods.","1997-03-01","2023-07-12 05:31:32","2023-07-12 05:31:32","2023-07-12 05:31:28","47-92","","1-2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/07370024.1997.9667240","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/N47U2XJ3/Stevens et al. - 1997 - Access to Mathematics for Visually Disabled Studen.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

UnWind incorporates the benefits of biofeedback and sedative music to facilitate deep breathing, moderate arousal, and promote mental relaxation. We evaluated Unwind in a 2 × 2 factorial experiment with music and biofeedback as independent factors. Forty young adults performed the relaxation exercise under one of the following conditions after experiencing a stressful task: Nature sounds only (NS), Nature sounds with music (NM), and Auditory biofeedback with nature sounds (NSBFB), and UnWind musical biofeedback (NMBFB). The results revealed a significant interaction effect between music and biofeedback on the improvement of heart rate variability.

In contrast, the goal of this project was to evaluate the effectiveness of enhanced auditory menu cues in a simulated driving context. The advanced auditory cues of “spearcons” (compressed speech cues) and “spindex” (a speech-based index cue) were predicted to improve both menu navigation and driving. Two experiments used a dual task paradigm in which users selected songs on the vehicle’s infotainment system. In Experiment 1, 24 undergraduates played a simple, perceptual-motor ball-catching game (the primary task; a surrogate for driving), and navigated through an alphabetized list of 150 song titles—rendered as an auditory menu—as a secondary task. The menu was presented either in the typical visual-only manner, or enhanced with text-to-speech (TTS), or TTS plus one of three types of additional auditory cues. In Experiment 2, 34 undergraduates conducted the same secondary task while driving in a simulator. In both experiments, performance on both the primary task (success rate of the game or driving performance) and the secondary task (menu search time) was better with the auditory menus than with no sound. Perceived workload scores as well as user preferences favored the enhanced auditory cue types. These results show that adding audio, and enhanced auditory cues in particular, can allow a driver to operate the menus of in-vehicle technologies more efficiently while driving more safely. Results are discussed with multiple resources theory.","2015-01-02","2023-07-18 06:16:09","2023-07-18 06:16:09","2023-07-18 06:16:01","1-16","","1","31","","","Menu Navigation With In-Vehicle Technologies","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2014.925774","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/MCL8LCI9/Jeon et al. - 2015 - Menu Navigation With In-Vehicle Technologies Audi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sonification can be defined as the use of sound to display data of scientific interest in order to investigate structures, trends or patterns in the data. Background is provided from several perspectives: the use of the senses in the history of science, the strengths of human hearing, the recent technological availability of auditory interfaces, the development of sonification itself, and differentiation of sonification from musical practices. In Western science, as in Western culture, the eye has become the predominant organ of sense; using the ear consciously in research thus implicitly questions the implications of the eye's predominance. As practical examples, two applications of sonification to data-sets from the social sciences are discussed in detail. We argue that the most promising areas of application of sonification within the social sciences are in the exploration of sequential data. Our two examples both concern sets of sequential data, one temporal, the other spatial (geographical). Discussion of these examples is followed by consideration of the practical and cultural implications of working with sonification. We thus hope to further the use of sonification in the social sciences, not as an alternative to visualisation or statistical approaches, but as a complementary tool of data analysis and exploration.","2006-12-01","2023-07-18 06:16:09","2023-07-18 06:16:09","2023-07-18 06:16:02","349-364","","4","31","","","Sounds sequential","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1179/030801806X143286","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/PFCTBLER/Dayé and de Campo - 2006 - Sounds sequential sonification in the social scie.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, even this broad definition neglects the contribution of perceived fun and enjoyment to user satisfaction and preferences. Therefore, we recently suggested a model taking ""hedonic quality"" (HQ; i.e., non-task-oriented quality aspects such as innovativeness, originality, etc.) and the subjective nature of ""appealingness"" into account (Hassenzahl, Platz, Burmester, & Lehner, 2000). In this study, I aimed to further elaborate and test this model. I assessed the user perceptions and evaluations of 3 different visual display units (screen types). The results replicate and qualify the key findings of Hassenzahl, Platz, et al. (2000) and lend further support to the model's notion of hedonic quality and its importance for subjective judgments of product appealingness.","2001-12-01","2023-07-18 06:16:09","2023-07-18 06:16:09","2023-07-18 06:16:05","481-499","","4","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327590IJHC1304_07","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/WDB6A4NW/Hassenzahl - 2001 - The Effect of Perceived Hedonic Quality on Product.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experimental work on learning and memory is extensive, particularly for verbal learning. However, little attention has been paid to the relative effectiveness of auditory and visual presentation. We warn against simply transferring techniques developed in more traditional audiovisual systems, arguing instead for an approach based on experimental analysis. In this article we review studies that suggest a series of tentative guidelines on the use of auditory and visual presentation in multimedia learning systems. These guidelines are intended as an aid to both programme developers and users, but they also serve to highlight areas requiring further research.","1992-01-01","2023-07-18 06:16:09","2023-07-18 06:16:09","2023-07-18 06:16:06","79-99","","1","4","","","Interactive multimedia for instruction","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10447319209526029","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But, in some cases, it is difficult or even impossible to recruit representative users because they have disabilities that do not allow them to take part in such investigations. Thus, alternative populations are widely studied. The most common way to replace real blind people is to use sighted but blindfolded users when studying design solutions. To test whether such alternative or proxy users can be used to represent blind people in social interactions, we examined the communication quality of 20 blind-sighted pairs and 20 blindfolded-sighted pairs in two different experiments. A prototype named E-Gaze glasses was evaluated as the testing tool. Results clearly show that the blindfolded participants achieved significantly higher communication quality than the blind participants. In qualitative data analysis, the blindfolded participants also reported their user experience of being blindfolded in conversations. Our qualitative results strengthen the conclusion that blindfolded users’ behaviour is different from real blind users’ behaviour. We recommend that blind users should not be substituted for blindfolded users in human product evaluations when communication quality is measured.","2023-07-06","2023-07-18 06:16:09","2023-07-18 06:16:09","2023-07-18 06:16:07","1-19","","0","0","","","Can blindfolded users replace blind ones in product testing?","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2023.2226768","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/8PJ8XD5Y/Qiu et al. - 2023 - Can blindfolded users replace blind ones in produc.pdf","","","visual impairments; Accessibility; alternative users; communication quality; proxy user; representative user","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we suggest that sound and graphics together can be used to improve interaction. We describe an experiment to improve the usability of standard graphical menus by the addition of sound. One common difficulty is slipping off a menu item by mistake when trying to select it. One of the causes of this is insufficient feedback. We designed and experimentally evaluated a new set of menus with much more salient audio feedback to solve this problem. The results from the experiment showed a significant reduction in the subjective effort required to use the new sonically-enhanced menus along with significantly reduced error recovery times. A significantly larger number of errors were also corrected with sound.","1999-01-01","2023-07-18 06:16:09","2023-07-18 06:16:09","2023-07-18 06:16:08","165-177","","3","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/014492999119066","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/SS78CKAJ/Brewster and Crease - 1999 - Correcting menu usability problems with sound.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
