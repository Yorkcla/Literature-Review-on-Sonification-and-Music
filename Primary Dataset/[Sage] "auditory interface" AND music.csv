This paper presents usability testing of an auditory prototype interface developed using the work domain analysis of ecological interface design (EID). An interface design that provides the user with sufficient preview to avoid obstacles may offer more environmental information than the single tones of the current designs.","2007-10-01","2023-07-06 06:22:53","2023-07-06 06:22:53","2023-07-06 06:22:43","278-282","","4","51","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/D7M8HT76/Davies et al. - 2007 - Testing a Novel Auditory Interface Display to Enab.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Systems must convey complex messages. To do so, systems can play: 1) a single sound that represents the entire message, or 2) a single sound that represents the first part of the message, followed by another sound that represents the next part of that message, etc. The latter are known as concatenated auditory icons. To evaluate those approaches, participants interpreted single and concatenated auditory icons designed to convey their message well and poorly. Single auditory icons designed to convey their message well were correctly interpreted more often than those designed to convey their message poorly; that was not true for concatenated auditory icons. Concatenated auditory icons should not be comprised of a series of sounds that each represents its piece of a message well. The whole of a concatenated auditory icon is not the sum of its parts.","2022-09-01","2023-07-06 06:22:53","2023-07-06 06:22:53","2023-07-06 06:22:45","1100-1104","","1","66","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/3FSDD4NC/Choi et al. - 2022 - Are Users Better Able to Correctly Interpret Singl.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this research is improved ergonomics and safety. The auditory displays in many safety critical human-machine systems today have poor design and there are many tradeoffs that should be considered. The meaning of an alert in its context, loudness level, confusion of signals, nuisance alarms, duration, urgency level and prioritization are only a few parameters that must be addressed. Natural Warning Sounds is a term for sounds that fulfill several requirements of a good design. These requirements are discussed in a thorough literature review (Ulfvengren, 1999) of fundamental principles of perception and information processing of sounds, their characteristics and their effect on performance and situational awareness. A multidisciplinary mix of people is involved in this research, which primarily concerns aviation, including engineers, a psychologist, a linguist, pilots and simulator-experienced researchers. Pilots contribute in interviews, experiments and simulations. Natural Warning Sounds are intended to convey relevant information, require fewer cognitive resources and increase performance in safety critical human-machine systems. The research includes analyses of existing systems, associability and soundimagery studies, and simulations for testing presentation logic.","2000-07-01","2023-07-06 06:22:53","2023-07-06 06:22:53","2023-07-06 06:22:48","742-745","","22","44","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/N9BHVE4N/Ulfvengren - 2000 - Natural Warning Sounds in Safety Critical Human-Ma.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Similarly, designers of user interfaces benefit from alternative interface techniques for usage scenarios in which visual (graphical) interfaces are either not possible or suboptimal. In our study we compared a traditional serial aural presentation of menu items to a new simultaneous aural presentation of up to seven menu items. These continuously present VoiceScapes allow the user to actively scan the auditory display to find the most appropriate command. While VoiceScapes are more difficult and attentionally more demanding than other formats of presentation, extended use might allow experienced users to more efficiently navigate complex menu hierarchies. A first pilot experiment with 13 sighted participants presented here tested the basic viability of this approach.","2015-09-01","2023-07-06 06:22:53","2023-07-06 06:22:53","2023-07-06 06:22:49","1095-1099","","1","59","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/46WBYBWK/Werner et al. - 2015 - Can VoiceScapes Assist in Menu Navigation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, the suitability of some auditory warning types, such as spearcons, as car warnings has not been investigated.MethodTwo experiments were conducted to assess the effectiveness of three auditory warnings (spearcons, text-to-speech, auditory icons) with different types of background noise while participants performed a simulated driving task.ResultsOur results showed that both the nature of the background noise and the type of auditory warning influenced warning recognition accuracy and reaction time. Spearcons outperformed text-to-speech warnings in relatively quiet environments, such as in the baseline noise condition where no music or talk-radio was played. However, spearcons were not better than text-to-speech warnings with other background noises. Similarly, the effectiveness of auditory icons as warnings fluctuated across background noise, but, overall, auditory icons were the least efficient of the three warning types.ConclusionOur results supported that background noise can have an idiosyncratic effect on a warning’s effectiveness and illuminated the need for future research into ameliorating the effects of background noise.ApplicationThis research can be applied to better present warnings based on the anticipated auditory environment in which they will be communicated.","2021-03-01","2023-07-06 06:22:53","2023-07-06 06:22:53","2023-07-06 06:22:51","312-335","","2","63","","Hum Factors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/AMDT6KXM/Šabić et al. - 2021 - Toward a Better Understanding of In-Vehicle Audito.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The APB's varied by sound dimension (pitch/duration change), polarity (increasing/decreasing) and wait time. APB did not impact wait perception significantly for sound dimension or polarity. Analysis of the first call a participant made to the system showed a strong interaction affect, with better performance in the increasing condition for the duration APB, and better performance for the decreasing condition in the pitch APB. However, extremely low customer satisfaction scores for all of the APB's indicated that participants were unhappy with the stimuli.

Background: With the shrinking displays of mobile devices and increasing technology use by visually impaired users, it becomes important to improve usability of non-graphical user interface (GUI) interfaces such as auditory menus. Using nonspeech sounds called auditory icons (i.e., representative real sounds of objects or events) or earcons (i.e., brief musical melody patterns) has been proposed to enhance menu navigation. To compensate for the weaknesses of traditional nonspeech auditory cues, the authors developed spearcons by speeding up a spoken phrase, even to the point where it is no longer recognized as speech. Method: The authors conducted five empirical experiments. In Experiments 1 and 2, they measured menu navigation efficiency and accuracy among cues. In Experiments 3 and 4, they evaluated learning rate of cues and speech itself. In Experiment 5, they assessed spearcon enhancements compared to plain TTS (text to speech: speak out written menu items) in a two-dimensional auditory menu. Results: Spearcons outperformed traditional and newer hybrid auditory cues in navigation efficiency, accuracy, and learning rate. Moreover, spearcons showed comparable learnability as normal speech and led to better performance than speech-only auditory cues in two-dimensional menu navigation. Conclusion: These results show that spearcons can be more effective than previous auditory cues in menu-based interfaces. Application: Spearcons have broadened the taxonomy of nonspeech auditory cues. Users can benefit from the application of spearcons in real devices.","2013-02-01","2023-07-06 06:23:10","2023-07-06 06:23:10","2023-07-06 06:23:10","157-182","","1","55","","Hum Factors","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/XKYEQLA8/Walker et al. - 2013 - Spearcons (Speech-Based Earcons) Improve Navigatio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
