This article looks to embodied cognition to provide an aesthetic framework for auditory display design. It calls for a serious rethinking of the relationship between aesthetics and meaning-making in order to tackle the mapping problem which has resulted from historically positivistic and disembodied approaches within the field. Arguments for an embodied aesthetic framework are presented. An early example is considered and suggestions for further research on the road to an embodied aesthetics are proposed. Finally a closing discussion considers the merits of this approach to solving the mapping problem and designing more intuitively meaningful auditory displays.","2014-04","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","70-77","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/VEBV4NPS/Roddy and Furlong - 2014 - Embodied Aesthetics in Auditory Display.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At times the relationship between emotion and sonification has been contentious due to an implied overlap with music. This paper clarifies the relationship, demonstrating how it can be mutually beneficial. After identifying contexts favourable to auditory display of emotion, and the utility of its development to research in musical emotion, the current state of the field is addressed, reiterating the necessary conditions for sound to qualify as a sonification of emotion. With this framework, strategies for display are presented that use acoustic and structural cues designed to target select auditory-cognitive mechanisms of musical emotion. Two sonifications are then described using these strategies to convey arousal and valence though differing in design methodology: one designed ecologically, the other computationally. Each model is sampled at 15-second intervals at 49 evenly distributed points on the AV space, and evaluated using a publically available tool for computational music emotion recognition. The computational design performed 65 times better in this test, but the ecological design is argued to be more useful for emotional communication. Conscious of these limitations, computational design and evaluation is supported for future development.","2014-04","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","60-69","","1","19","","","Sonification of Emotion","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/JTIRS57D/Winters and Wanderley - 2014 - Sonification of Emotion Strategies and results fr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its use of data at audio rate could be described as both audification and non-standard synthesis. The possibilities of audio-rate data use and the relation between the above descriptions are explored, and then used to develop a conceptual and theoretical basis of the work.Vickers and Hogg's term ‘indexicality’ is used to contrast audio with control rate. The conceptual implications of its use within the digital medium and the possibility for the formation of higher-order structures are discussed. Grond and Hermann's notion of ‘familiarity’ is used to illustrate the difference between audification and non-standard synthesis, and the contexts of auditory display and music respectively. Familiarity is given as being determined by Dombois and Eckel's categories of data. Kubisch's Electrical Walks, Xenakis's GENDYN and the audification of seismograms are used as examples. Bogost's concept of the alien is introduced, and its relevance to the New Aesthetic and Algorave are discussed. Sound examples from Construction in Self are used to demonstrate the varying levels of familiarity or noise possible and suggested as providing a way of bridging the divide between institutional and underground electronic music.","2014-04","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","78-89","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/RK4FEMAC/Ikeshiro - 2014 - Audification and Non-Standard Synthesis in Constru.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Coming from the disciplines of computer sciences and human computer interface (HCI), the conceptualisation of sonification has been mostly driven by application areas and methods. On the other hand, the sonic arts, which have always participated in the auditory display community, have a genuine focus on sound. Despite these close interdisciplinary relationships between communities of sound practitioners, a rich and sound- or listening-centred concept of sonification is still missing for design guidelines. Complementary to the useful organisation by fields of application, a proper conceptual framework for sound needs to be abstracted from applications and also to some degree from tasks, as both are not directly related to sound. As an initial approach to recasting the thinking about sonification, we propose a conceptualisation of sonifications along two poles in which sound serves either a normative or a descriptive purpose. According to these two poles, design guidelines can be developed proper to display purposes and listening modes.","2014-04","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","41-51","","1","19","","","Interactive Sonification for Data Exploration","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/PU82B573/Grond and Hermann - 2014 - Interactive Sonification for Data Exploration How.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, the origins of integrated audiovisual art in the output of John Whitney are explored. Then, metaphors based on musical textures are used to describe different approaches to the audiovisual medium. Research into perception and auditory displays are next used to justify the simultaneous representation of the same data in both the audio and the video. The aesthetic potential of this practice is then corroborated using Michel Chion's theory of sound in cinema. In concluding, its possibilities for providing an appropriate form and aesthetic approach to the audiovisual material are discussed.","2012-08","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","148-155","","2","17","","","Audiovisual Harmony","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/CKHBPZL5/Ikeshiro - 2012 - Audiovisual Harmony The realtime audiovisualisati.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design of the sound space is guided by four principles which match perceptual structure with data structure to improve natural comprehension of an auditory display. These principles – completeness, comprehensibility, consistency, and cohesiveness – have been generalised from the use of colour displays in scientific visualisation. The choice of perceptual parameters to represent different types of data is informed by the body of psychoacoustic literature. The raw material for the construction of the sound space is the McGill University Master Samples (MUMS) palette of musical instrument samples. This is an important choice because this reference resource enables reproduction and confirmation of the results. The construction was carried out in four stages – the ‘pedestal’, the ‘skin’, the ‘skeleton’ and the ‘flesh’. The pedestal consists of eight equally discriminable timbres organised in a circle by perceptual similarity. The skin is the boundary of variation in the space, defining the limits of dynamic range for pitch and brightness at each timbre. The skeleton characterises the internal behaviour of the space at a number of perceptually measured points. The flesh is a continuous medium moulded to the skeleton and skin, realised by a three-dimensional (3D) regularised linear spline interpolation. The concrete realisation of the sound space can be investigated through a user interface, called the GamutExplorer. Colour visualisations of slices and wireframe views of the 3D space can be chosen, and sounds can be picked with a mouse.","1996-08","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","2023-07-11 06:36:54","125-136","","2","1","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/Users/minsik/Zotero/storage/7CZ95Q3H/Barrass - 1996 - Sculpting a sound space with information propertie.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
